## Syllabus

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective.

**TERM 2 Design**: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.

**The Second Term Design Studio** aims to refine the work developed by students during the first term of the Master program. After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and first interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on finding and growing their communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world (digital or physical).


## Learning Objectives
The specific goals are the following: 
- Further explore areas of interests identified in Term I
- Involve others to become part of their design processes
- Bring forth design interventions with their communities of practice to explore an area of interest.
- Reflect on the becoming, outputs and outcomes of design activities

**Keywords: Design Interventions, Community of Practice, Prototyping, 1st Person Research through Design, Design Space, Documentation and Communication**


## Schedule

We suggest engaging in an average of four collective design interventions this term, but naturally it can change depending on the project, the evolution or the student’s personal circumstances. The number four is a guideline.

=== "08/01"

    **Collective design intervention: a collective design action with humans and/or non-humans - Jana & Roger**

    **Goals:** Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a new scope, goals and next steps.

    **Activity:** Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 1st trimester.

    **Assignment:** Reflect on your and your project’s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back. Analyze your so-called “failures” as opportunities for redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project accordingly.

    **Deliverable:** An updated version of your design space. A 500 word text with a summary of your journey so far, adding the repositioning of yourself and your project.  Make explicit new project goals and next steps including a proposal for the 1st intervention of the second trimester (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after).

=== "20/01"

    **20/01 Exploring alternative presents in context. Look for your peers and communities and make sense of a 1PP Design Action. Expand the boundaries of your interventions - Jana & Roger**

    **Goals:** Understand yourself better as a design tool in contexts, learn how to properly document, analyze and make sense of a design action from a 1PP. Explore your biographies and analyze your way of drifting in order to make sense of the alternative present you are creating.

    **Activity 1:** Briefly present in class an updated version of the design space and a proposal for the 1st intervention of the second trimester.

    **Activity 2:** Analyze the evolution of your design space to reflect on your way of drifting to envision your future biography by means of an alternative present.

    **Activity 3:** Plan your first design intervention of the term and map the actors and infrastructure you want to involve. 

    **Task:** Carry out your 1st design intervention from a 1PP with your community of practice (involve yourself in the context you want to work on).

    **Deliverable 1:** Document the design intervention, analyze it and reflect on the findings. 

    **Deliverable 2:** Map, visualize and analyze the evolution of your design space based on ways of drifting and reflect on the trajectories you might want to project. Create a narrative in relation to your alternative present. 

=== "03/02"

    **03/02 Being thorough with your Research  - Toni Llàcer**

    **Goals:**

    - Emphasize the importance of rigor and depth in design research to inform interventions.
    - Introduce methods for collecting, analyzing, and organizing data to strengthen research outcomes.
    - Highlight strategies for linking insights to actions, ensuring research is actionable and grounded in real-world contexts.
    - Foster critical reflection on the research process, encouraging students to question assumptions and biases.

    **Activity:**

    TBD

    **Task:** 

    - Plan and execute a design intervention using the opportunity given with the micro challenge, to use research insights to inform the approach.
    - Document and analyze the intervention, focusing on how research guided the decisions and outcomes.

    **Deliverable 1:**

    *One step further than the video: Intervention Report*

    A detailed document that includes:

    - Research methods used.
    - Key findings and insights.
    - Analysis of how findings influenced the design intervention.
    - Reflection on what worked, what didn’t, and areas for improvement.

    **Deliverable 2:**

    *Updated Design Space*: Visual or conceptual updates based on new findings and relationships built during the intervention.

=== "17/02"

    **The Ethics of Making: Accountability in Design Practices - Toni Navarro y Alejandra Lopez Gabrieliris**

    **Goals**:

    - Explore the ethical dimensions of design and its impact on emergent futures.
    - Develop a critical perspective as a foundational skill for analyzing and questioning assumptions, frameworks, and contexts.
    - Emphasize the importance of commitment and thoroughness in the design process, highlighting accountability and sustained effort.
    - Equip students with tools to integrate ethics into their interventions, ensuring designs advocate for equity, sustainability, and resilience.

    **Activity**: TBD

    **Task**:

    - Develop a short manifesto or set of principles outlining your ethical commitments as a designer.
    - Reflect on your current project, identifying areas where ethical considerations can be strengthened or reframed.

    **Deliverable 1**: Visual or conceptual map showing the relationship between your design values, ethical commitments, and project goals.

    **Deliverable 2**: Carry out your design intervention. Analyse it, reflect on the findings.

## Grading Method

| Percentage  | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------            |
| 50%         | Faculty (including written assignment)          |
| 50%         | Self-Evaluation                                 |

Self-Evaluation Question: Look back at the interventions you did last term and analyze them by self-evaluating your development:

- How much have you involved your community through your design interventions?
- Did your process involve others in the design and implementation of the interventions? How meaningful do you think the interventions were for the external people that were involved?
- In terms of situating your interventions, how successful were you in considering the resilience, material flows, situated knowledges and existing infrastructures in your design process?
- Were you able to draft an alternative present through the iterative reflective process offered by the outcomes of your design interventions?
