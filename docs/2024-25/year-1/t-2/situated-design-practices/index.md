## Syllabus

Students will explore four distinct situated design practices. The course offers two complementary levels of exploration: one focused on geographical contexts and the other driven by community engagement. While these approaches can be examined separately, their materiality and meaning often intersect. The course invites students to discover, visit, and contextualize various metropolitan areas of Barcelona. Through this journey, we will delve into their unique identities, historical narratives, and contemporary realities. Students will engage with local communities involved in diverse professional and personal practices. We will also foster connections with lawyers, journalists, and niche internet personalities to better understand how communities emerge or are shaped—whether recognized or hidden, institutionalized or marginalized, celebrated or stigmatized.

Ben Ditto is a creative director living and working in London. Ditto’s projects span a broad spectrum of disciplines including moving image, CGI, creative coding, branding, AI, print and live experience to name just a few. Ben’s utilisation of Instagram as a tool for reportage on topics ranging from military hardware to surgical procedures – and everything in between – has gained him a cult online following and propelled him to the realm of “niche micro-internet celebrity”. This led to the cultivation of an online community, Ditto Nation, on Telegram and Discord, as well as a documentary series under the same name. Ben is also the art director of his eponymous publishing company Ditto, and founded Dazed Beauty alongside Isamaya Ffrench. Ditto was recently appointed as the creative director of Desdemona, a robot created in a collaboration between Hanson Robotics and Singularity Net, with the aim of creating the future of AI celebrity.
