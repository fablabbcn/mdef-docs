## Syllabus

The human body is both the source and the expression of emotions. In today’s digital era, where virtual environments mediate social interactions, the body finds new ways to be present, leading to a shift in how emotions are communicated. From an interdisciplinary approach, this workshop explores concepts related to affective computing, embodiment, creative coding and prototyping. Participants will use their bodies to sense and capture its behaviors, and will create prototypes to record this data. They will learn to build DIY wearable sensors to track bodily behaviors and explore ways to transform this information into visual or sound representations. The workshop proposes to introduce embodied interaction as a framework to explore how the experiences of the body can play a significant role in the way we conceptualize and engage with technology.

## Materials

All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the classes. Bring in your laptop with the proper software installed prior to the class if required (emails will be sent prior to the classes regarding this aspect).
