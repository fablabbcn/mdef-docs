## Syllabus

**The Atlas of Weak Signals - A collective inquiry and embodied research of emerging signals**

This workshop focuses on collaboratively reviewing the Atlas of Weak Signals, reviewing its relevance and collaboratively updating Signals through their research and insights. Students will engage in embodied research activities aimed at exploring alternative and pluralistic futures to identify and visualize weak signals. Through collaborative design exercises, the students will actively participate and shape the AOWS co-design methodology. Collectively, we will use digital and analog collage techniques to design the new cards, which will be added to an online repository.
​​
**Keywords: Pluriverse, Atlas of Weak Signals, Ontological Design, Transition Design** 

### Learning Objectives

- Explore co-design and future(s) methodologies and their application.
- Co-develop new themes and cards for the Atlas of Weak Signals through a collective, iterative, critical inquiry design process.
- Collectively review, test, and evaluate co-designed Signals to assess their significance.


### Methodological Strategies

Different methodological strategies that will allow the development of the learning skills and results.
Example:
- Horizon Scanning 
- CIPHER workshop sheet and methodology
 
Other types of learning strategies associated with the program experience.
Example:
- Peer learning.
- Team-based learning.
- Critical Inquiry 
- Co-design methodologies

## Schedule

=== "Wednesday 03.04.2024"

    #### ***Wednesday 03.04.2024, 10:00 - 14:00 and 15:00 - 17:30***

    Workshop sessions will be divided into five on each other building moments. 

    - Revisiting the AOWS - Collective sharing round and reflection 
    - Horizon scanning exercise - reviewing their areas of research and materializing trends
    - Utilizing existing methods to frame signals and test them for their validity 
    - Polarization and provocation - A critical reflection on the identified signals 
    - Creative expression of the newly identified Signals
    - Upload of Signal cards to a shared repository 


## Deliverables

Each student will be tasked with prototyping a card of the Atlas of Weak Signals (AOWS).. Throughout this process, students will reflect on the polycrisis factors, critically and explore unconventional ideas. They will consider the tools and resources necessary to uncover unseen and unheard stories, allowing them to identify weak signals effectively. By critically evaluating their approach and identifying potential barriers they are invited to think beyond conventional boundaries and how to include pluralistic approaches in their design practice.
