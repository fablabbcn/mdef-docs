## Syllabus

**The Atlas of Weak Signals - A collective inquiry and embodied research of emerging signals**

This workshop focuses on developing and testing co-design methodologies for the creation of new cards for the Atlas of Weak Signals card deck. Students will engage in embodied research activities aimed at exploring alternative and pluralistic futures to identify and visualize weak signals — emerging trends or phenomena that may have significant impacts in the future. Through collaborative design exercises, the students will actively participate and shape the AOWS co-design methodology. Students will gain insights into embodied research methodologies –  while contributing to the expansion of the Atlas of Weak Signals card deck.
​​
**Keywords: Pluriverse, Atlas of Weak Signals, Ontological Design, Transition Design** 

### Learning Objectives

- Explore co-design and future(s) methodologies and their application.
- Explore design themes such as design for the pluriverse, design ontologies & epistemologies. 
- Co-develop new themes and cards for the Atlas of Weak Signals through a collective, iterative, critical inquiry design process.
- Collectively review, test, and evaluate co-designed cards to assess their significance.

### Methodological Strategies

Different methodological strategies that will allow the development of the learning skills and results.
Example:
- Horizon Scanning 
- CIPHER workshop sheet and methodology
 
Other types of learning strategies associated with the program experience.
Example:
- Peer learning.
- Team-based learning.
- Critical Inquiry 
- Co-design methodologies

## Schedule

=== "Wednesday 03.04.2024"

    #### ***Wednesday 03.04.2024, 10:00 - 14:00 and 15:00 - 17:30***

    Workshop sessions will be divided into five on each other building moments. 

    - Revisiting the AOWS - Collective sharing round and reflection 
    - Horizon scanning exercise - Materializing trends in the polycrisis 
    - CIPHER methodology application for identified themes - Utilizing existing methods to frame signals and test it for their validity 
    - Polarization and provocation - A critical reflection on the identified signals 
    - Creative expression of the newly identified cards 

## Deliverables

Each team will be tasked with prototyping a new area of the Atlas of Weak Signals (AOWS) along with its connected cards (up to five weak signals). Throughout this process, teams will reflect on the factors that may have hindered their ability to think critically and explore unconventional ideas. They will consider the tools and resources necessary to uncover unseen and unheard stories, allowing them to identify weak signals effectively. By critically evaluating their approach and identifying potential barriers they are invited to think beyond conventional boundaries and how to include pluralistic approaches in their design practice.
