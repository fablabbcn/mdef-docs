## Syllabus

We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces who’s underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design.Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world.

Is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication, physical computing and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience for rapid prototyping.

We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an “honest” mechanical artifact.

**Keywords: Documentation, Tinkering, Design, Prototyping, Digital Fabrication**

### Learning Objectives

Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and spiral development, designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition.

**Instrumentation**

- Rapid prototyping 
- Physical computing

**Exploration**

- Design maker workflows
- Navigate through the uncertainty

**Reflection**

- Critical thinking about technologies
- Redesign new systems

**Application**

- Maker skills
- Hack systems


### Materials Needs

All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the workshop.

Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers...

Do you have any old appliances (radios, toys, telephones, lamps, screens, keyboards...) at home you would like to take apart? Bring them, too! (For safety reasons, avoid choosing appliances with a lot of power or that are easily heated).

## Schedule

The course duration is a total of 32 hours of guided workshop time, spanned along two weeks.

The guided workshop time will happen Tuesday to Friday and the students are committed to work during the afternoon in the projects on a self-guided methodology.

**Classes:** 09:30 to 13:30 (16 per week)

- Hands-on sessions guided by instructors

**Autonomous work:** from 14:30 to 18:00 (16 per week)

- Non guided sessions where students work on a task independently or in groups


**Group work:**

- Non-guided sessions where students work on a task independently or in groups

=== "15/10"

    **Tuesday**: Presentation & Unpacking (I know what's inside)

=== "16/10"

    **Wednesday**: Disassemble (I’m not afraid of exploring)

=== "17/10"

    **Thursday**: Forensic (I know what I have)

=== "18/10"

    **Friday**: In-Control (I built something I trust)

=== "22/10"

    **Tuesday**: What to do with these parts (Beta devices)

=== "23/10"

    **Wednesday**: Integration of artifacts (I build something that works)

=== "24/10"

    **Thursday**: Field visit & recordings during the afternoon

=== "25/10"

    **Friday**: Final Presentations(I have a final machine)

## Deliverables

![](/assets/images/2024-25/year-1/t-1/the-machine-paradox-deliverables.png)

Students are requested to submit all the material requested by the faculty + their reflections about the seminar on their personal blog on the [MDEF repository](https://mdef.fablabbcn.org/2024-25/students/) on GitHub within a maximum of 1 week after the students’ submission deadline.

**In addition, videos and presentations must be submitted in the Submission folder within the seminar's Google Drive folder, which we share with you.**

- Write a post out your weekly experience (personal MDEF webpage)
- Deliver the forensic report completely filled
- Add link to the exploration tools and files you produced and used in your repo
    - Video and Slide
    - Forensic report

### Video

- Video at minimun 1080p stabilized (not hand held recordings, use a tripod if you don't know how to stabilize with software)
- **BETWEEN 30SEC TO 1MIN**
- Open source music matching the artifacts (properly acknowledged).
- Ideally, the sound produced by the machine will also be recorded in the video.
- Entry and finish titles with team names, name of the artifact and Iaac/FablabBCN.

### Slides

- Design process (how did you ideate)
- What it is supposed to do or not do
- Ideas or concept in the context
- How is it made (Materials, parts)
- System diagram (illustration explaining function, parts, and relations)
- The coding Logic (Algorithms and flowcharts, pseudocoding)
- Photographies
- Iteration Process
- Learning by Accomplishments and failure
