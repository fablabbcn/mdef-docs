## Syllabus

This design seminar on data-driven analysis-design process to understand and address local needs on different dimensions: social, physical/urban, environmental. In order to facilitate this process, the seminar will be developed in 2 separate, but complimentary parts:

- First (21st-25th of October), working on social and physical vulnerability, exploring the collaborative dimension of design, and focusing on open spaces.
  
- Second (25th-29th of November), working on environmental vulnerability, exploring the ecological dimension of design, and focusing on ecological connectivity.

The students will focus on the development of these principles, working in groups, and in a close-by location (Santa Coloma de Gramenet), combining on-the-field observation with data analysis and design.
