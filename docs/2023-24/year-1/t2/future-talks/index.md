Future Talks is a series of conversations with friends of ELISAVA and Fab Lab Barcelona, exploring the nature of emerging futures from the past to the present and beyond.

## Syllabus

Research has shown that most of the job opportunities and future challenges that will arise in the next few years still don’t exist. Instead of seeing it as a threat, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision and identity rather than passively wait for what is needed.

In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development especially in a master program full of activities. We want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills and attitudes to compare yourself with.

In this series of talks, critical reflection will help you to map your strengths and weaknesses in relation to the approach to design that the master is proposing. A series of presentations and visits to key professionals will make you aware about how your thinking, making, interests and values differ from others.

## Deliverables

At the end of this trimester we ask you to update who you are and what makes you unique (identity) and your personal “vision” of your future as a professional. The Thesis Draft will include space to reflect on your Vision and Identity and how that evolved this term.
For this section we ask you all to reflect on how applicable and useful the knowledge presented by each of the guests is in your practice/project. Please do a self-reflective paragraph long post on each of the talks.

**These are the points we are going to look for the evaluation of Future talks:**

- Attendance
- Understanding of your design interventions in the context of the future talk.
- Reflection and application (if relevant) of future talk on practice.
- What opportunities might arise by taking these future talks into consideration.
