## Syllabus

The course offers designers and makers a comprehensive introduction to the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The program focuses on empowering participants with the knowledge and skills required to extract mainstream AIs (such as GPT or DALL-E) into external interfaces. 

Course Contents:

- Showcase of Salient Projects: The instructors will showcase their most salient and relevant projects that demonstrate the creative possibilities of generative AI for designers and makers.

- Introduction to Generative AI: Participants will gain a clear understanding of the concept of generative AI, its principles, and its applications. They will learn about algorithms, models, and techniques used in generative AI.

- Exploring OpenAI: Students will be introduced to OpenAI, a powerful platform for developing AI-based applications. They will learn how to access and utilize OpenAI tools to leverage generative AI for their own projects.

- Web-Based Application Development: The course will provide hands-on training in developing a small application using generative AI algorithms. Participants will learn how to create a web-based application that connects to OpenAI and generates unique designs based on user inputs.

- Design Considerations and Ethics: The course will also address the ethical considerations associated with generative AI. Participants will learn about responsible AI usage, ethical design principles, and the importance of considering privacy and bias while utilizing generative AI for their projects.

By the end of this short course, participants will have developed a solid foundation in generative AI and gained practical experience in creating their own web-based application utilizing OpenAI. They will be equipped to explore the endless possibilities of generative AI in their future design and making endeavors.

**Keywords: Generative Artificial Intelligence, AI-Driven Web Applications, Rapid Prototyping**

## Schedule

=== "Day 1"

    - Introduction, who we are. Pietro, Chris + DOTTOD
    - Projects showcase 
    - Introduction to the class assignment
    - Group making and hardware setup (helping students to get started)

=== "Day 2"

    - The evolution of LLMs and diffusion models
