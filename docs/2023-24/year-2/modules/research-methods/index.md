## Syllabus

The second year of the IAAC Master programs is dedicated to the development of an Individual thesis agenda, where students delve into an in depth and independent research within the broader context of their specific program of choice. In support of this process, the Research & Methods Course offers itself as a platform oriented to the learning, understanding and application of specific research and experimental skills to develop and manage research processes and content. The course follows the learning by doing methodology applied at IAAC, whereby students test the research skills acquired through the course within the context of their individual thesis agenda. Students also develop critical thinking competencies to support data acquisition, literature review processes and state of the art analysis. The goal of the course is for the students to be versed in the learnings of the course by the end of the cycle, empowering them to be confident and independent researchers. The course includes all phases of the research, from designing the research itself, the program of study, to practical information on localising sources and databases, defining key research objectives, selecting a methodology, designing and developing experiments, determining a related and selected bibliography, and compiling the thesis delivery in itself, all focussed on understanding and prioritising information.

## Format

The course is run in a mixed format consisting of short lectures and development exercises. Each class/development exercise, the students will treat a new subject related to their research development, from planning their research, methods and skills, research protocols and databases, to the delivery of their thesis.
