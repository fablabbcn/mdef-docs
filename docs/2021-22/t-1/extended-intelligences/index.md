## Syllabus

### Extended Intelligences (Context workshop)
Extended intelligences introduce the fundamental idea of intelligence further than the human brain. In this process, we will explore the autonomization of the object, the collective dimension of intelligent behavior, and the challenges that they pose in shaping today's world.
Output: A scaffolder of an automated decision tool.

### Designing with AI (Experience workshop)
Hands-on approach to the state of the art of artificial intelligence tools. We will take personal images from our mobile phones library and experiment with neural networks to create alternative selves. From image generation to image classification primarily using StyleGAN but also CLIP 101 (D-ALLE) and YOLO. The class will be built around a collection of Collab (Google Cloud Jupyter Notebooks environment) predefined python scripts.
Output: Images of an alternative self.
