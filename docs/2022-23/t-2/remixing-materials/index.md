## Syllabus 

This course will introduce students to the world of bio-based materials and upcycling, with a focus on hands-on exploration and prototyping. Students will learn about the principles of biomaterials, including how to grow and manipulate them, and will have the opportunity to prototype their own projects using a range of techniques such as composites, modeling and casting, and 3D printing.

For many years designers thought of materials as something to choose from a catalog, a patented formula developed in giant laboratories. However, our home kitchen offers tonnes of possibilities to start the design process from material sources such as waste and use systemic design practices to connect it with the local socio-economic context.

The course will also include a section on remixing in context, where students will learn how to connect their material choices and upcycling projects with the local socio-economic context.

## Deliverables

- Develop an understanding of the principles of biomaterials and the potential for using waste materials in upcycling projects.

- Understanding the potential for using locally sourced and waste materials in the design process, and the role of designers in connecting their work to the local socio-economic context.

- Explore a range of techniques for prototyping and manipulating bio-based materials.

- Connect material choices and upcycling projects with the local socio-economic context through the use of systemic design practices.

- Create and present a final project that demonstrates the use of bio-based materials and upcycling techniques.
