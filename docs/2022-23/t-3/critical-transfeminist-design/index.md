## Syllabus 

In these two sessions, we will tackle an introduction to a transfeminist perspective applied to design and experimental practices. How does it affect operating from a transfeminist perspective in the field of design? Is it possible to design differently? What is Design Justice? What are the ethical issues raised by these approaches? Is it possible to relate differently to technologies and through technologies? What happens to presences? And who is accountable for absences? Who do we relegate to a condition of subalternity? How do we deal with epistemic violence?

- To understand the importance of the place of enunciation in Design.

- To learn about different transfeminist proposals applied to design and experimental research.

- Understanding the importance of accountability.

- To know the basic principles of the so-called Design Justice.
