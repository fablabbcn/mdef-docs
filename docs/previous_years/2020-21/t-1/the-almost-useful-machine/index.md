## Syllabus

Fab Labs and advanced manufacturing infrastructure are making accessible for any citizen to make anything anywhere while sharing it with global networks of knowledge, which allows accelerating design, development, and deployment processes for new products to be born. Traditional planning and urbanism are being disrupted by the acceleration of technology and the dynamic transformation of society during the last half-century; it is important to rethink how we make things and why, and generate active and practical conversations through projects and prototypes that become manifests itself.

 [TAUMs](https://hackmd.io/TdLbzvcbTrm8HG6xkYFNeg#The-Almost-Useful-Machines-Weeks---TAUMs) is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience during Fab Academy.

We will be going over the basic skills needed to design, develop, and fabricate almost anything in a Fab Lab, as well as how to manage time and resources necessary for its proper operation.

Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and **spiral development**, designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition.

We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program **an “honest” mechanical artifact that “makes” something.**

USELESS MACHINES

As existential purity, building a machine that doesn´t have a clear purpose as fabricating something or solve world problems allows the designer to focus on mechanics and movements allowing more freedom to really simplify actuation forgetting about constraints.

The metaphor of machines and artifacts doing endless predefined or random movements is what we call Useless Machines.

Students will develop and fabricate something that is a mess of contradictions and wonderfulness.

UNPACKING INTELLIGENT MACHINES

An introduction to physical computing by hacking everyday objects

We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces whose underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design.

Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world.

## Deliverables

“Honest” mechanical artifact (1 input and/or 1 outputs + 2 differents fabrication process)

## Evaluation

Reflection (post): 5%

Conceptualitzation (From ideas to artifacts): 30%

Assistance: 10%

Involvement (individual): 10%

Presentation (slides and videos): 40%

If it does not explode: 5%


## Materials

All the electronics materials as development boards, sensors, and actuators will be provided during the workshop.

As well as the fabrication materials.

Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers…

Do you have any old appliances at home you would like to take apart? Bring them, too!

## Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga

![](../../../../assets/images/faculty_photos/santi_fuentemilla_garriga.jpg)

Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga (male), with Master of Architecture from the
University of la Salle Universitat Ramon LLull , Spain, as a specialist in
Architectural Design and Construction. In 2012 he graduated from the Fab
Academy Diploma at FabLab BCN, a digital fabrication and rapid prototyping
course directed by Neil Gershenfeld at MIT ́s Center For Bits and Atoms (CBA).
Currently, he is undertaking a PHD in digital fabrication processes at the EGA
UPC (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya). As a professional Santi has worked in
various architectural firms carrying out projects at the international level in the
last 10 years. He is currently the design director at OPR (Other people’s Rooms)
in Barcelona, a multidisciplinary studio based on architectural concept design for
enhanced user experiences.

Since 2013 he is part of the Fab Lab BCN team, he is the coordinator of the
Future Learning Unit (FLU), the unit focused on the design, implementation and
coordination of active learning experiences with digital manufacturing tools for
the community. FLU designs and promotes educational, innovation and
entrepreneurship projects such as AmbMakers POPUPLAB "Digital Fabrication
Everywhere", FABKIDS, CROCOPOI. FLU participates in European research
projects such as DOIT or DSISCALE and PHALABS 4.0.

Since 2014 he is Fab Instructor of the global academic program Fab Academy
and since 2017 he is professor of the Master in Design for Emergent Futures
MDEF organized by IAAC.

## Guillem Camprodon

![](../../../../assets/images/faculty_photos/guillem_camprodon.jpg)

Guillem Camprodon is a designer and technologist working on projects bridging emergent technologies and grassroots communities. He is the director of Fab Lab Barcelona, the first Fab Lab in the European Union and a benchmark in the network of over 1800 Fab Labs. Over the last ten years, he helped scale Fab Lab Barcelona from a digital fabrication facility into an established research and innovation laboratory. He led Smart Citizen, a platform that opposes the traditional top-down Smart City model, empowering communities with tools to understand their environment. Guillem worked as a researcher on many European-funded projects, including Making Sense, iSCAPE, GROW Observatory, Organicity, DECODE, ROMI, or Reflow. He is also a lecturer in multiple IAAC programs, primarily at the Master on Design For Emergent Futures (MDEF).




## Víctor Barberán Soler

Víctor Barberán is an Industrial Designer with more than 20 years of experience developing custom technology for multidisciplinary art and science projects. Throughout his career, Victor Barberán has worked in electronics design, software development, data analysis, modelling and animation, and digital postproduction. Currently, Victor works as part of the Fab Lab Barcelona as a software and hardware developer in multiple research projects, such as the Smart Citizen project. He is also the Electronics lead for the Fabricademy, Fab Academy and the Masters of Design for Emergent Futures program.




## Eduardo Chamorro Martin

![](../../../../assets/images/faculty_photos/eduardo_chamorro_martin.jpg)

Eduardo Chamorro is an architectural technologist, additive manufacturing expert and researcher, focusing on digital fabrication, materials, robotics and emerging technologies.

He is currently a PhD candidate at Swinburne University (Melbourne, Australia) in High performance composites additive manufacturing for architecture.

Works as faculty and researcher at FabLab Barcelona & IAAC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia) in Barcelona, Spain as faculty in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF), Master for Advanced Architecture (MAA), Master in Advanced Ecological Buildings (MAEB), 3D Printing in Architecture (3DPA), FabAcademy at IAAC FabLab Barcelona. For him, working in a multi-scalar environment must be the priority of architects nowadays. His research focuses on the implementation of additive manufacturing technologies along different architectural scales imaging multiple processes and materialities.
