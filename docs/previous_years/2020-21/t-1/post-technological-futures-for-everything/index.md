## Syllabus

Following a collective learning-by-doing approach, the students will explore, discuss, reflect, ideate, and exchange perspectives, questions, and thought experiments, while exercising their collective imaginations with long-term, critical and planetary mindsets to navigate the complexity, scale, and speed of change of the multidimensional implications that the digital economy has in the environmental emergency.

Using [The Everything Manifesto](https://www.iam-internet.com/everything) as a meta-brief, participants will have the opportunity to learn how to use hypothetical questions to develop useful fiction stories about how everyday life can change in the next billion seconds, following methodologies where they can practice collective ideation, decision making, and other collaborative approaches.
