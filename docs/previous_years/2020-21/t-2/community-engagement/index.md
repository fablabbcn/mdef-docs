## Syllabus

Design practice and the role of the designer has been evolving over time. Evolving from a utilitarian perspective at the service of industry (design over) to the integration of the perspective of the human user and its needs (design for) and, later on,  it’s integration as an active agent in the design process (design with) the agency and expertise of the designer has been critically put into question generation after generation. Presencing the burst of the user-centered bubble and in the face of various existential risks, along with these sessions, we will inquire over our role as designers and experience what it means to design within creative communities with the goal of putting our personal projects and capacities at the service of deep transitions.  

## Deliverables

Students will have a variety of deliverables to fulfill on a weekly basis. They will be also be asked to iterate on their current practices and projects integrating the content and guidance offered in the sessions.
