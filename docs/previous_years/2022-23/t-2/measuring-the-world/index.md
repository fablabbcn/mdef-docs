## Syllabus and Learning Objectives

Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analogue and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like, post-processing, storage and consumption. It aims to work both as an introduction to some key concepts behind physical computing to support the Machines that Make but more importantly as an introduction to the idea of information which is critical to the Extended intelligence module.
