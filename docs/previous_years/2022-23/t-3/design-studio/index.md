# Design Studio 3
### From Alternative Presents to Emerging Futures



## Track
Application

## Faculty
Olga Trevisan and Sally Bourdon

## Syllabus

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective.

**TERM 2 Design**: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.

The third term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by the students during the first two terms of the Master program. After finding and engaging with communities of practice in the second term through a number of initial interventions, students will be encouraged to grow and consolidate those relationships and take a step further. They will design and deploy one last intervention that can serve as closure for their journey in the Master program. At the same time it will act as a launching pad for establishing the alternative presents where they will continue shaping their envisioned emergent futures after the end of the programme.

## Schedule

### 11/04 Kick off - Framing your first Design Intervention for Term III

**Goals**: Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a first design intervention for the term.

**Activity**: Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 2nd trimester. Present your personal alternative present.

**Deliverable**: A proposal for the first intervention of the term based on the alternative present created (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after).

**Task**: Start preparing and carrying out your first design intervention.


### 17/04 Design Studio Reviews


### 24/4 Alternative presents to emergent futures- triggering tomorrow’s tomorrow:  MDEF Alumni Roundtable (TBC) Nicolas + Roberto + Magda + Mitalee

**Goals**: Learn from different case studies how a 1PP alternative present design research investigation can become diverse professional roles, collaborations and hybrid ongoing practices.

**Activity**: Roundtable contrasting different perspectives and life-stories.

**Deliverable**: Update your alternative present including a description of the roles you would like to have in it.

**Task**: Update your bio section in your website with an adaptation or your alternative present and your role. Continue developing your interventions.

*Tip: if  you can gain access to GPT3/4, try conversing with the chat to come to an understanding of your potential alternative bio – see what arises.*



### 02/05 Design Studio Reviews


### 08/05 Scalability - Designing yourself out - Decentralized strategies for sustaining continuity and scalability - MDEF Alumni Guest Presentations (TBC)

**Goals**: Sustaining your activities and impact in a more decentralized manner, enabling for the extension of capacity and globalization of the efforts

**Activity**: To reflect on the structural, narrative, documentation and outreach dimensions of your interventions.

**Deliverable**: Visualize the socio-technical system of your project (updated Design Space). Show possible paths of growth with new or existing actors.

**Task**: Create a scalability roadmap for decentralization using the strategies presented in class.

*To Pablo: estaría bien que se prepare el activity: identifying milestones, turning points, roles and strategies undertaken towards your alternative present.*




###	15/05 Design Studio Reviews


### 22/05 Scalability - Designing yourself out - Decentralized strategies for sustaining continuity and scalability. Guest Alumni: Clement Rames & Lea Karrasch

**Goals**: Sustaining your activities and impact in a more decentralized manner, enabling for the extension of capacity and globalization of the efforts.

**Activity**: To reflect on the structural, narrative, documentation and outreach dimensions of your interventions

**Deliverable**: Visualize the socio-technical system of your project (updated Design Space). Show possible paths of growth with new or existing actors.

**Task**:  Create a scalability roadmap for decentralization using the strategies presented in class.


### 12/06 - 25/06 MDEFEST (DATES TBC)

**Goals**: MDEFEST aims to celebrate the end of the Masters’ journey by offering a series of sessions hosted by the students on the topics and projects they worked all year long.

**Activity**: Sessions will last maximum half a day, can be digital or physical (with remote streaming), done individually or in groups (preferably) and can be in the format of a workshop, a debate, a visit, a meetup or any kind of format the students find suitable for this experience.

**Deliverable**: Two-week time-frame to hold the sessions planned for the Fest.

### End of academic year deliverables - Due date: 16th of June.

**_10 High-resolution photos of the journey of your project and final interventions_**

**_Master Thesis - Chapters 0-11, adding this Term the following chapters:_**

**Chapter 8**: Final Interventions: Descriptions and results

**Chapter 9**: Final Alternative Present

**Chapter 10**: Designing yourself out: Strategies for Continuity and Scalability

**Chapter 11**: Final Reflection

**Reference Sources / Bibliography**

**_(2-5) min Video_**

Selected physical exhibition material for **IAAC and Elisava**- Poster + physical prototypes to be displayed for a few days (TBC with Chiara)


## Grading Method

33% of the evaluation will be the Design Studio faculties’ combined grade, 33% will be the average grade your peers give you, and 33% will be the completion of your first Thesis draft.
