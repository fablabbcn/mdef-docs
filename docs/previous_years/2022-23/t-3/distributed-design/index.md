## Syllabus 

What is Distributed Design? Aside from making, what do we aim to distribute? What are the values behind the design approach and how can they be used for designers and creatives to reflect on their design projects? How can we also use the values to measure impact in the creative and design industries? How can the Distributed Design Platform help advance the field of Distributed Design and provide support for emerging creative talents in the creative and design industries?

These are the questions that we will address during the three-class seminar: Reflecting on Distributed Design.

We will talk about the field of distributed design and how our vision of it has evolved to distribute not just making but to distribute knowledge, value and power. We will talk about Distributed Design and the Distributed Design Platform (DDP) as a space to unite approaches and methodologies including (but definitely not limited to) Doughnut Economics, Decolonizing Design, Ancestral Wisdom and Transfeminism.

 We’ll do an initial exploration of the Distributed Design Platform (DDP) and the values and opportunities it presents. We’ll also explore the importance of measuring impact in the design and creative fields and the tool we’ve developed (the DDP Reflection Tree) as part of DDP to help assess the environmental and social impact. The seminar will also provide students with the opportunity to apply the DDP Reflection Tree to their final projects and foster moments for group reflections. Lastly, we’ll explore the DDP values together and consider how they might be defined.
