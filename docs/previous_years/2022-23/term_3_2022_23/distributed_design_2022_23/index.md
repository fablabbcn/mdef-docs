#  Distributed Design
### Reflecting on Distributed Design

## Syllabus and Learning Objectives

What is Distributed Design? Aside from making, what do we aim to distribute? What are the values behind the design approach and how can they be used for designers and creatives to reflect on their design projects? How can we also use the values to measure impact in the creative and design industries? How can the Distributed Design Platform help advance the field of Distributed Design and provide support for emerging creative talents in the creative and design industries?

These are the questions that we will address during the three-class seminar: Reflecting on Distributed Design.

We will talk about the field of distributed design and how our vision of it has evolved to distribute not just making but to distribute knowledge, value and power. We will talk about Distributed Design and the Distributed Design Platform (DDP) as a space to unite approaches and methodologies including (but definitely not limited to) Doughnut Economics, Decolonizing Design, Ancestral Wisdom and Transfeminism.

 We’ll do an initial exploration of the Distributed Design Platform (DDP) and the values and opportunities it presents. We’ll also explore the importance of measuring impact in the design and creative fields and the tool we’ve developed (the DDP Reflection Tree) as part of DDP to help assess the environmental and social impact. The seminar will also provide students with the opportunity to apply the DDP Reflection Tree to their final projects and foster moments for group reflections. Lastly, we’ll explore the DDP values together and consider how they might be defined.    




## Total Duration
9 class hours

## Structure and Phases

### Class one: Theoretical (Wednesday, 12th April 2023)

In this first class, students will learn about the evolution of the DDP and essential topics related to the field of Distributed Design. We will also present the DDP values and talk about the importance of measuring impact. Lastly, we will cover useful information from the DDP, like members, resources and opportunity tracks that students might pursue.


### Class two: Practical (Thursday, 13th April 2023)

The DDP Reflection Tree will be introduced as a tool to help designers understand their project’s relationship to the values of the DDP, while also providing invaluable insight for the DDP team into the impact of DD in the creative and design industries, as well as helping the DDP provide essential support to creative talents. Students will be split into groups of four to work on applying the DDP’s Reflection Tree to their projects. Lastly, students will identify challenge areas they would like to further develop and receive feedback from their peers.


### Class three: Practical & Theoretical (Friday, 14th April 2023)

Following working with the DDP values in the Reflection Tree, students will work on contributing to the values.

**Step 1 (1 hour)**: Students will break out into groups (4) around each of the DDP values and brainstorm what they envision the value looking like, based on the inputs from the seminar, the master’s course and their own experience. They will have to create a presentation (using whatever format they see fit i.e powerpoint, theatrical piece, poster) to share with the rest of the class.

**Step 2 (40 minutes)**: Students will present the work on their respective value (10 minute per presentation)

**Step 3 (1 hour 20 minutes)**: The class and instructors will collectively provide feedback to each of the value presentations to help form what the values could look like.
