## Syllabus

Students will participate in a series of workshop activities that address challenges for quickly embodying concepts, and addressing them through lived experiences.

Throughout the week, students will engage in early and easy making processes. They will address the experiences of these things through the body. Each student will move through:

· Lo-fi version of their project/concept

· Different time scales

· Move from speculation to have a component of reality for their concept.

On the final day, students will present their experiences my means of videos.

## Deliverables

Research artifacts, lo-fi version of project/concept, personal reflection.
