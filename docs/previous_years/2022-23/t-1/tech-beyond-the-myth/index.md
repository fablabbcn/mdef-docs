## Syllabus

We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces who’s underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design. Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world.

Is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication, physical computing and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience for rapid prototyping.

Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and spiral development, designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition.

We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an “honest” mechanical artifact.

>### Forensics of the obsolescense (Context workshop)
Forensics of obsolescence confronts students with the results of today's consumers' electronics industry model. By tearing apart broken everyday objects we uncover key topics such as systems thinking, suppli chains, intellectual models, or programmed obsolescence. On top of it, by using a hands-on approach we introduce the use of fundamental technology prototyping concepts: datasheets, multimeter, power supplies, electronic tools. Students will document their findings by writing a "forensic report" of each artifact.

Output: A written "forensic report".

>Measuring the world introduces students to the concept of a world in data by designing artifacts to measure their daily analog and digital activity. The fundamental aspect is to understand nowadays data-driven world from the sourcing, that could range from a temperature sensor to an Instagram like postprocessing, storage, and consumption. It aims to work both as an introduction to some key concepts behind physical computing to support the Machines that Make but more importantly as an introduction to the idea of the information that is critical to the Extended Intelligence module.

Output: A dataset

>### Machines that make, materials that grow (Context workshop)
Machines that make introduces the fundamental concepts of digital fabrication when we move away from rapid prototyping and explore the true potential of from bits to atoms [...] from making to growing.
Output: A drawing of a future machine that grows.

>### Almost useless machines (Experience workshop)
Almost useless machines focus introduces the core idea actuating the real world by asking students to assemble a mechanical artifact with no much purpose than itself. Its primary goal is to move away from students from the small-scale, almost invisible, digital-only approach to technology highly influenced by today's service economy into the scale of artifacts that impact and transform the physical world. In the making, students will put into practice the fundamental stages of rapid prototyping in Fab Labs from building a mockup to integrating multiple digitally fabricated components into a working artifact.

Output: A useless machine

## Deliverables

Students are requested to submit all the material requested by the faculty + their reflections about the seminar on the MDEF repository on GitLab https://mdef.iaac.net/ within a maximum of 1 week after the students’ submission deadline.

- Write a post out your weekly experience

- Deliver the forensic report completely filled

- Reflect your learning goals and possible applications of the technology learned

- Add link to the exploration tools and files you produced and used in your repo (Video and Slide presentation, Forensic report)


**All the students have to document their work for the course:**

- **Personal reflexions and learning outcome post** (personal MDEF webpage)

- **Video and Slides of the machine** (Google drive)

The deadline for the students to submit their work for your seminar is Sunday the **18th of November**.

**Video**

- Video at minimun 1080p stabilized (not hand held recordings, use a tripod if you don ́t know how to stabilize by software) BETWEEN 30SEC TO 1MIN

- Open source music matching the artifacts(properly acknowledged).

- Ideally, the sound produced by the machine will also be recorded in the video.

- Entry and finish titles with team names, name of the artifact and Iaac/FablabBCN .


**Slides**

**Forensic report abstract (reflection)**

- Design process (how did you ideate)
- What is supposed to do or not to do.
- Ideas or concept in the context
- How is it made (Materials, parts)
- System diagram (illustration explaining function, parts, and relations)
- The coding Logic (Algorithms and flowcharts, pseudocoding )
- Photographs of the end artifacts 
- Iteration Process - Learning by Accomplishments and failure
