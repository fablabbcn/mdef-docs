# Design Ethics


## Track
Reflection

## Faculty
Ariel Guersenszvaig

## Syllabus

In these three sessions we will tackle an introduction to the philosophy of technology and the central theme of our relationship with technology: are we determined by technology? Do we determine the technology or should the issue be explored in a radically different way? We will then deal with current topics in ethics and artificial intelligence. After that, we will end by reflecting on what it can mean to be a professional designer.


**Objectives**

- To understand the nature of technology and its relationship with humans.

- To know the limits and potentialities of ethical reflection.

- To gain an awareness and understanding of ethics and its entailments for the design profession
