Exploring emergent technologies continues the journey through the underlying layers, the boundaries, and the frictions of modern tech.

We will focus on emergent technologies, in other words, cultural practices we might have heard about, but we want you to explore on your own, to question and master them, before they become a marketing buzzword.

We selected two key areas of exploration:

### Remixing Materials:

We will take a hands-on approach to materials, with a specific focus on upcycling waste into newer materials and bio-based recipes. For many years designers thought of materials as something to choose from a catalog, a patented formula developed in giant laboratories. However, our home kitchen offers tonnes of possibilities to start the design process from material sources such as waste and use systemic design practices to connect it with the local socio-economic context.

#### Collective intelligence:

More than a space for collective exploration, the Internet became a magnified lens of existing systems of power. In the last term, in the Extended Intelligences seminar, we looked at the applications and implications of AI, this time we will unfold technologies and key concepts that could allow users to retake collective control of nowadays digital platforms.
