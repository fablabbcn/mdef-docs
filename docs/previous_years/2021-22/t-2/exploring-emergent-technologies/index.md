Exploring emergent technologies continues the journey through the underlying layers, the boundaries, and the frictions of modern tech.

We will focus on emergent technologies, in other words, cultural practices we might have heard about, but we want you to explore on your own, to question and master them, before they become a marketing buzzword.

We selected two key areas of exploration:

### Remixing Materials:

We will take a hands-on approach to materials, with a specific focus on upcycling waste into newer materials and bio-based recipes. For many years designers thought of materials as something to choose from a catalog, a patented formula developed in giant laboratories. However, our home kitchen offers tonnes of possibilities to start the design process from material sources such as waste and use systemic design practices to connect it with the local socio-economic context.

#### Collective intelligence:

More than a space for collective exploration, the Internet became a magnified lens of existing systems of power. In the last term, in the Extended Intelligences seminar, we looked at the applications and implications of AI, this time we will unfold technologies and key concepts that could allow users to retake collective control of nowadays digital platforms.  


## Lara Campos - Remixing Materials

Material driven designer, researcher and textile artist. Her practice blurs the boundaries between materials, technology and biology, proposing new perspectives on biocentric design. Lara believes that design can open a space for dialogue between human beings and other living beings. Her work is based in nature as cognified matter. Her research focuses on emotional response, merging biomaterials with digital fabrication. Through textiles, she proposes the exploration of new habitable spaces, as sensorial and interactive experiences in order to ideate on better solutions of coexistence. To support and expand her exploratory nature, she is also researching on re-designing and upcycling organic food ‘waste’ turning it into objects, and facilitates talks and biomaterials workshops where she proposes the exploration of the organic matter as a contemporary artistic practice.

Inspired by textile storytelling, she has got a degree in textile design and combined it with different courses of craft techniques. Later on during Fabricademy course at Fab Lab Barcelona, she learned about bio- design, digital manufacturing and wearable technology to develop smart and sustainable textiles. Currently she delves into biomaterials & biodesign, and is part of S-Biotica collective, with whom she is working to set up a co-creation space in Barcelona for bio-based research and design.
