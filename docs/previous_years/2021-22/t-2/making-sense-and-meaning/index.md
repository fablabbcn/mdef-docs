# Making Sense and Meaning

![](images/making_sense_and_meaning.jpg)
## Track
Reflection

## Faculty
Tomas Diez

## Syllabus

Following a collective learning-by-doing approach, the students will explore, discuss, reflect, ideate, and exchange perspectives, questions, and thought experiments, while exercising their collective imaginations with long-term, critical and planetary mindsets to navigate the complexity, scale, and speed of change of the multidimensional implications that the digital economy has in the environmental emergency.

Using [The Everything Manifesto](https://www.iam-internet.com/everything) as a meta-brief, participants will have the opportunity to learn how to use hypothetical questions to develop useful fiction stories about how everyday life can change in the next billion seconds, following methodologies where they can practice collective ideation, decision making, and other collaborative approaches.



## When  
Mondays, from 9 to 11 am.

## Schedule
**“Meaning is a property of intelligence. If planet Earth is the only place with intelligence in the entire galaxy, then is on planet earth where meaning can only exist”** - Brian Cox. English physicist and former musician who is a professor of particle physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester and The Royal Society Professor for Public Engagement in Science.

It might be hard to accept that humans have full responsibility for the current climate emergency and social imbalances, but we have designed all of it. Designing something is not just to define is aesthetics or proportions, neither is limited to objects. Design is about making decisions or provoking decisions of others. You either take your private car or public transport, both are decisions in which you are designing the way you are going to go from point A to point B. But beyond the trip from A to B, you are also designing how much are you going to pollute today, or if you do not have any other choice because you live in an American suburb, then your mode of transport has been decided already for you. Design is the attitude we have towards the simple things of everyday life, to the more transcendental ones that we believe transform our lives or other people’s lives forever. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions, but it also needs to be a collective effort in order to synchronize interventions at multiple scales that will allow the human species to inhabit and coexist on this planet with other forms of life, which are needed to sustain human life itself.

Finding meaning and purpose is a lifetime discovery, that could be perpetual and take many lives. For centuries, humans have been using different tools in order to expand their understanding of the world they could see, smell, touch, listen, and taste. Philosophy helped us ask questions that go beyond what our senses can detect and our brains can process. Religion provided answers to many existential questions by transposing the human power to higher beings or spirits. Science aims to respond to existential questions with hard facts, based on the scientific method of proposing theories and then prove them right. How one can navigate in such a complex configuration of belief systems, overlapping between each other, and still feel part of something? As designers, it is important to align our belief system with our actions and build meaningful connections with what we do, from simplicity (that can be transcendental) to complexity. We will not be able to respond definitive answers during this course, but we aim to expand the world’s views of the course participants (students, tutors, guests) through fruitful debate and discussions.

##Course objective:
One of the main goals of MDEF is to align students’ purpose with their skills, interests, and capabilities, in order to provide all the necessary means to become agents of change. In times of transition, exposure to excessive noise and information lead to uncertainty and disconnection from the true self. Through questioning students’ decisions and choices during their project development, these sessions aim to rebuild the connection with the driving forces that operate within ourselves and to establish new dialogues with authors, researchers, thinkers, and makers that can contribute and enrich the Masters’ projects. The seminar aims to build a space for honest discussion, questioning, and challenging, in which we aim to incorporate philosophical practice into designing for emergent futures.
