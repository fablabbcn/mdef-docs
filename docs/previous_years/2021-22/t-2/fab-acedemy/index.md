## Syllabus

The [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/) is a **distributed educational model** directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, [MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/). The Fab Academy began as an outreach project from the CBA, and has since spread to Fab Labs around the world. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through a unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources.

During **this 6-month** programme, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.

## Learning Objectives

**The goal of MDEF version** is to combine the concepts and practices of the Fab Academy program with the objectives of the MDEF course in a meaningful way to develop student research projects.

A core aim is to empower students with hands-on prototyping in the Fab Lab environment, unlocking technological ‘black boxes’ to create a deeper understanding of technology in designing for emergent futures.



## Methodology

The program applies FabAcademy mindset without modifying the global schedule, but applying new methodologies such as "rotational task's stations", redistributing the impact of weekly hours and adding new assessment criteria.

The instructional design of the course has two fundamental assumptions, individual reflection tasks for each weekly topic, and monthly intensive maker-sprint in the form of “micro-challenges”. Students work in small groups to develop week-long projects applying knowledge and skills from the previous Fab Academy topics with concepts related to MDEF and their research projects, aimed to bridge the gap that has existed between these two courses and demonstrates the competencies acquired.

## Schedule:

**Global Class**: These classes are given by Neil Gershenfeld, broadcasted **every Wednesday at 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EST (3:00 PM Barcelona Time**). The lectures are recorded and available to students throughout the semester.

**Local Classes**: This classes are given every Wednesday from 10 Am to 13.00 Pm (CET time)

**Lab life**: In addition to the lectures, there are 2 lab days each week where students have access the digital fabrication equipment and personal help with projects. Fabrication time previous booking system.

**Expert Support**: timeframe open to book appointments on specific subjects or expertise.




## Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga

Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga (male), with Master of Architecture from the
University of la Salle Universitat Ramon LLull , Spain, as a specialist in
Architectural Design and Construction. In 2012 he graduated from the Fab
Academy Diploma at FabLab BCN, a digital fabrication and rapid prototyping
course directed by Neil Gershenfeld at MIT ́s Center For Bits and Atoms (CBA).
Currently, he is undertaking a PHD in digital fabrication processes at the EGA
UPC (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya). As a professional Santi has worked in
various architectural firms carrying out projects at the international level in the
last 10 years. He is currently the design director at OPR (Other people’s Rooms)
in Barcelona, a multidisciplinary studio based on architectural concept design for
enhanced user experiences.

Since 2013 he is part of the Fab Lab BCN team, he is the coordinator of the
Future Learning Unit (FLU), the unit focused on the design, implementation and
coordination of active learning experiences with digital manufacturing tools for
the community. FLU designs and promotes educational, innovation and
entrepreneurship projects such as AmbMakers POPUPLAB "Digital Fabrication
Everywhere", FABKIDS, CROCOPOI. FLU participates in European research
projects such as DOIT or DSISCALE and PHALABS 4.0.

Since 2014 he is Fab Instructor of the global academic program Fab Academy
and since 2017 he is professor of the Master in Design for Emergent Futures
MDEF organized by IAAC.

## Eduardo Chamorro Martin

Eduardo Chamorro is an architectural technologist, additive manufacturing expert and researcher, focusing on digital fabrication, materials, robotics and emerging technologies.

He is currently a PhD candidate at Swinburne University (Melbourne, Australia) in High performance composites additive manufacturing for architecture.

Works as faculty and researcher at FabLab Barcelona & IAAC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia) in Barcelona, Spain as faculty in the Master in Design for Emergent Futures (MDEF), Master for Advanced Architecture (MAA), Master in Advanced Ecological Buildings (MAEB), 3D Printing in Architecture (3DPA), FabAcademy at IAAC FabLab Barcelona. For him, working in a multi-scalar environment must be the priority of architects nowadays. His research focuses on the implementation of additive manufacturing technologies along different architectural scales imaging multiple processes and materialities.

Eduardo holds a Master's Degree in Architecture from CEU San Pablo University (Spain), a Fab Academy diploma in Digital Fabrication offered by the Fab Lab Network and a Master's Degree in Advanced Architecture from IAAC (Spain), with a specialisation in digital fabrication, materiality novel design methodologies. He holds as well a Spanish architectural licence.

Moreover, he has worked as Fab Lab Seoul director, researcher at several architecture studios, professor of computational design and fabrication at CEU University and advisor for various architecture collectives. He is also a regular collaborator at Fab Lab Madrid. He is always seeking innovative architecture that attempts to solve and adapt to social needs. He has also been a tutor for the Master of Science in Computational and Advanced Design (MSc CAD) at Design Morphine - UACEG (University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy).

## Josep Marti Elias
