## Syllabus

Every future scenario is built by detecting “weak signals” that set trends and point to certain directions, based on the analysis of the main change factors we can detect in the present.

Any cartography we use for understanding the present requires an analysis of the main crises that determine our collective future. Towards the end of the 21st century, these include at least an ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, a crisis of neoliberalism as the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years, multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, a crisis of the discourses that grew with the digital utopias, a crisis of the productive model and the nature of work, a crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business, and last but not least, a migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply. These vectors, and some others, define the territory in which we build our collective projects and our hopes for collective development.

As a transversal and ongoing project of the Masters in Design for Emergent Futures, the Atlas of the Weak Signals presents a space and a structure in which to navigate and position ourselves in this complex panorama, allowing for students and faculty to find design and intervention contexts and opportunities.

From these vectors, this seminar presents stories, narratives, proposals and images that allow the construction of an Atlas of Weak Signs for the design of Futures.
