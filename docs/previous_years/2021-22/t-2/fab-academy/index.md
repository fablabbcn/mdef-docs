## Syllabus

The [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/) is a **distributed educational model** directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s Center For Bits and Atoms and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course, [MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/). The Fab Academy began as an outreach project from the CBA, and has since spread to Fab Labs around the world. The program provides advanced digital fabrication instruction for students through a unique, hands-on curriculum and access to technological tools and resources.

During **this 6-month** programme, students learn how to envision, prototype and document their projects and ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools, taking a variety of code formats and turning them into physical objects.
