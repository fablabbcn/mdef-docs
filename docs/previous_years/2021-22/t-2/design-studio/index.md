### Embodying Emergent Contexts

## Track
Application

## Faculty
Oscar Tomico, Mariana Quintero, Tomas Diez, Jonathan Minchin, Kate Armstrong, Tomas Vivanco, Guillem Camprodon

## Syllabus

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective.

**TERM 2 Design**: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.

The second term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by students during the first term of the Master's program. After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and first interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on finding and growing their communities of practice and developing interventions in the real world (digital or physical).

## When  
**Tuesdays** from 2 to 7 pm, every two weeks

## Schedule

### Tuesday 11/01 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - Kick-off - Reframing by reflecting on your project so far

**Goals**: Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a new scope, goals, and next steps.

**Activity**: Briefly present in class 3 of the main learning points from the 1st trimester.

**Objectives:** To incorporate a series of tools and methodologies to navigate through complexity in a current continuously changing reality.

**Assignment**: Reflect on your and your project’s current stage of development and by means of comparing yourself and your current project to previous projects, situations you have been in, and other projective techniques that will be explained in class.

**Deliverable**: An updated version of your design space with a 500-word text with a summary of your journey so far, contextualizing your new locality and community. Make explicit new project goals and next steps including a proposal for the 1st intervention of the second trimester (a draft will be discussed during the design reviews the week after).

### Tuesday 25/01 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - A 1PP Design intervention in context. Look for your peers and communities

**Goals**: Understand better yourself as a design tool in contexts, learn how to properly document, analyze and make sense of a design action from a 1PP.  

**Activity 1**: Briefly present in class a proposal for the 1st intervention of the second trimester.

**Activity 2**: Plan your first design intervention of the term and map the actors and infrastructure you want to involve.

**Task**: Carry out your 1st design intervention from a 1PP (involving yourself in the context you want to work on).

**Deliverable 1**: Document the 1PP design intervention, analyze it, and reflect on the findings. Describe the alternative present scenario that this intervention is offering.

**Deliverable 2**: Update your design space with the relations you have built.

### Tuesday 08/02 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - Network of co-responsibility. (Co-)designing for emergent futures in the present.     

**Goals**: Reflect on your network of co-responsibility. Look for your peers and communities to get feedback from.

**Activity**: Present your results from your 1PP design intervention. Reflect on your work based on Sergio’s Future Talk and guidelines given in class.

**Activity 2**:  Analyze and map the reach of what you are able to respond to. Decide which relations you need to be co-responsible for and which you can delegate.

**Task**: Plan and execute a 2nd design intervention, a collective design intervention.

**Deliverable**: Document the 2nd collective design intervention, analyze it and reflect on the findings. Describe the alternative present scenario that this intervention is offering.

**Deliverable 2**: Update your design space with the relations you have built.

### Tuesday 22/02 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - Pushing the boundaries of your interventions

**Goals**: Understand how an exercise in radicality might serve as a tool to expand the limits of the alternative presents you are proposing.

**Activity 1**: Present your results from your 2nd design intervention.

**Activity 2**: Focus on your doubts and limitations and try to learn about them through designing an intervention with the resources you have.

**Task**: Plan and execute a 3rd design intervention, a final and more complete one.

**Deliverable 1**: Document the final design intervention, analyze it, and reflect on the findings. Describe the alternative present scenario that this intervention is offering.

**Deliverable 2**: Update your design space with the relations you have built.



### Tuesday 08/03 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - Biographies and constituencies. Ways of drifting in post-human design. (Ron Wakkary)

**Goals**: Understand the agency of the context you are working in. Let the human and non-human actors be a driving force in your project.

**Activity 1**: Present your results from your 3rd collective design intervention.

**Activity 2**: Reflect on your project from a Post-human design perspective. Map the actors and infrastructure you have involved and include them in the 3 iterations of your design spaces.

**Deliverable**: Map, visualize and analyze the evolution of your design space over the 3 iterations based on ways of drifting.

### Tuesday 15/03 - 2:00 to 7 pm CET - Design Dialogues II Preparation with Kate

**Goals**: Create a collective and individual building-up plan for the Design Dialogues exhibition.

**Activity**: Group dynamic to create themes and groups of projects for the exhibition.

**Deliverable**: Planning of the exhibition, space allocation, and special needs.

**Task**: Work on the design dialogues deliverables.

### Tuesday 28/03 - Time TBD - Design Dialogues


### Deliverables - Due date: Friday, 22nd of April

**(Optional)** 2-5 min video-documentary (video-journaling) of your 3 Term II interventions - for presenting during Design Dialogues and for uploading to the Emergent Futures Community

Visual material to support the exhibition.

Evolution of physical and/or Digital prototypes from your **Design Space**

5 high-resolution images of your interventions during the term

Thesis Draft - Chapters 4-6 are made up of the weekly deliverables for this term. (Due Friday 22nd of April):

**Chapter 4**: Reframing of the project - Include here the reflection you did in the beginning of Term II.

**Chapter 5**: TERM II Interventions - a. Document here each of the interventions and experiments you deployed this term. b. Document the evolution of your Design Space throughout these interventions. c. Reflect on the Alternative Present that you are creating with your project.

**Chapter 6**: Updated Vision and Identity (Future Talks Reflection) - Include here a revised version of your Vision and Identity chapter from Term I, commenting on the key inspirations and learnings you take from the guests we invited for the Future Talks
