## Syllabus

The recent growth of the international DIY-Bio / I-GEM and Bio Hackers networks are born of a motivation to narrow the golf between research conducted in institutional and corporate settings and to redirect the scientific locus back towards citizen scientists. The agenda of democratising access to the sciences is shared with that of libre software and open source electronics and maker movements.

Access to the means experimentation for the investigative and applied sciences will not only change the way we understand and describe the world but also bring forth new knowledge, designs and engineering practises previously constrained to larger scale operations. Through the course, researchers will learn how to identify microorganisms, how to take samples and prepare cultivation medias, how to observe microscopic organisms and to obtain amplify DNA and analyse it. Researchers will be introduced to scientific concepts such as sterility, metabolism, genome, synthetic biology, biochemistry and microbiology. Gaining the ability to makecreative decisions and construct logical frameworks for study and production in the field of biology.

## Deliverables

Biology

- A hypothetical yet designed experiment following the scientific method.

- Scientific paper identification, reading, and synopsis.

Agronomy

- A group species identification datapoint map based on city and forest foraging.
