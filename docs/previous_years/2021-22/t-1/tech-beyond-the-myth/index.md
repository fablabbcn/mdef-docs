## Syllabus

We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces who’s underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design. Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world.

Is a practical and intensive two-weeks experimental program into fabrication, physical computing and introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience for rapid prototyping.

Our active learning methodology is based on the practice and spiral development, designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition.

We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an “honest” mechanical artifact.

## Deliverables

Students are requested to submit all the material requested by the faculty + their reflections about the seminar on the MDEF repository on GitLab https://mdef.iaac.net/ within a maximum of 1 week after the students’ submission deadline.

- Write a post out your weekly experience

- Deliver the forensic report completely filled

- Reflect your learning goals and possible applications of the technology learned

- Add link to the exploration tools and files you produced and used in your repo

**All the students have to document their work for the course:**

- **Personal reflexions and learning outcome post** (personal MDEF webpage)

- **Video and Slides of the machine** (Google drive)

The deadline for the students to submit their work for your seminar is Sunday the **18th of November**.

Presentation Requirements

### Video

- Video at minimum 1080p stabilized (not hand held recordings, use a tripod if you don´t know how to stabilize by software)

- Black, gray, white or color (studio background).

- Libre music matching the artifacts(properly acknowledged).

- Ideally the sound produced by the machine will be also recorded in the video.

- Entry and finish titles with Team names, name of the artifact and Iaac/FablabBCN.

### Slides

**Forensic report abstract (reflection)**

- System diagram (illustration explaining function, parts, and relations)

- How did you fabricate it (fabrication processes and materials)

- The coding Logic (Algorithms and flow charts, pseudocoding)

- Design process - Why -(reflection about design process)

- Photographs of the end artifacts at high res.

- Learning by Accomplishments and failures
