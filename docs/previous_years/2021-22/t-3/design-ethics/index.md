## Syllabus

In these three sessions we will tackle an introduction to the philosophy of technology and the central theme of our relationship with technology: are we determined by technology? Do we determine the technology or should the issue be explored in a radically different way? We will then deal with current topics in ethics and artificial intelligence. After that, we will end by reflecting on what it can mean to be a professional designer.


**Objectives**

- To understand the nature of technology and its relationship with humans.

- To know the limits and potentialities of ethical reflection.

- To gain an awareness and understanding of ethics and its entailments for the design profession

## Deliverables

2-3 page report containing an ethical assessment of one’s own course project based on the exercises performed during class + readings + contents of the lectures. The assessment should be reflective (not merely descriptive) and it should contain a discussion of themes in the project or of aspects thereof that merit ethical reflection. While not mandatory, it is recommended that it also included next steps or courses of action that can be taken to remediate ethical issues creating risks and harms.
