# Design Ethics


## Track
Reflection

## Faculty
Ariel Guersenszvaig

## Syllabus

In these three sessions we will tackle an introduction to the philosophy of technology and the central theme of our relationship with technology: are we determined by technology? Do we determine the technology or should the issue be explored in a radically different way? We will then deal with current topics in ethics and artificial intelligence. After that, we will end by reflecting on what it can mean to be a professional designer.


**Objectives**

- To understand the nature of technology and its relationship with humans.

- To know the limits and potentialities of ethical reflection.

- To gain an awareness and understanding of ethics and its entailments for the design profession

## When  
April 21, 25 and 28, from 10 am to 1 pm

## Schedule

3 in-person classes

### Day 1

- Technology and “us”

- Technology and values

- The normative power of artefacts

- Perspectives on technological intentionality

- **Exercise**: ethical-constructive technology assessment

### Day 2

- Ethical frameworks and their integration into design

-  Beyond the trolley problem

 - Case: ethical issues in IA

 - Case: autonomous weapons

- **Exercise**: value-sensitive design taster and Mepham’s matrix of one’s work

### Day 3

- Professional ethics

- Design as a practice

- Designers as professionals

- Design as self-enactment

- **Exercise**: Wrap-up

##Output
2-3 page report containing an ethical assessment of one’s own course project based on the exercises performed during class + readings + contents of the lectures. The assessment should be reflective (not merely descriptive) and it should contain a discussion of themes in the project or of aspects thereof that merit ethical reflection. While not mandatory, it is recommended that it also included next steps or courses of action that can be taken to remediate ethical issues creating risks and harms.

Submission deadline: May 30 2022

## Grading Method
Assignment: 70%

Participation: 30%
