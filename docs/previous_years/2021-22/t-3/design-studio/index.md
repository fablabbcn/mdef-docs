Structure of 2021-22
======================

# Design Studio



## Faculty
Tomas Diez, Oscar Tomico and Mariana Quintero      

## Syllabus

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analysing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective.

**TERM 2 Design**: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of emergent narratives.. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.

The third term Design Studio aims to refine the work developed by students during the first and second term of the Master program (research and design). After identifying areas of interest from weak signals in the first term, and creating their design space and interventions, students will be encouraged to take a further step into their projects, focusing on designing an improved intervention in the real world (digital or physical). Special efforts will be geared towards the development of projects in the context of the current global pandemic, and how such interventions take place in new contexts (domestic, digital, new locations), while contributing to the previous work in tems one and two, and continue building the project’s vision for desirable futures..

The Design Studio time will be dedicated to supporting the students to adapt their work in the current special global context, develop their final design intervention in new spaces, and communicate their project to build new narratives, taking into account the current “new normal”. During the studio, studio leaders will bring invited guests to introduce topics of interest to the process and to participate in tutorials during the desk crits.

## Deliverables

At the end of this trimester we expect you to update who you are and what makes you unique (identity) and your personal “vision” of your future as a professional. Create a specific post on your website.  


## Total Duration

Weekly studio days will be every Tuesday from 14:30hrs to 17:30hrs.

## Structure and Phases

### __Apr 16 - Kick off - My new me
**Activities**: Reflect on how the new normal is shaping you personally. Explore and document a day in your life with notes, photos, videos, self-interviews…

**Deliverable**: One post with some visuals (photo, video, graphics, moodboard,…). A short reflection in a 2-3 minute video, following the “youtuber” model..

### __Apr 21 - Mapping my domestic experimental laboratory
**Activities**: Accept and reflect on how the new normal is shaping you as a professional. Rethinking your new hyper-local and hyper-connected design space.

**Goals**: Being resilient and resourceful as a professional.

**Deliverable**: One post with a new design space including what infrastructure, people, things and materials became available either physical or virtual in this new normal.

###__Apr 28 - Experimenting with my project in emergent contexts
**Activities**: Looking for new meaningful actions, being resilient and resourceful.

**Goals**: Piloting a new intervention with yourself or close connections.

**Deliverable**: one post documenting your design actions with new normal design space and resources. Plan for your design intervention (after piloting yourself).

###__May 5 - Collaborating with others for my project in new spaces
**Activities**: Relating 1st, 2nd and 3rd person perspectives in a hyper-local and hyper-connected context.

**Goals**: Create a new intervention in this new normal.

**Deliverable**: one post with documenting your design intervention. A distributed, online collective design action.

###__May 12 - Creating your own biography and constituency
**Activities**: From a post-human design perspective explore your evolution (you and your context) from before and during the master.

**Goals**: Understand who you are and what you are capable of.

**Deliverable**: one post with visualizing own biography and constituency. Include a short reflection for each one.

###__May 19 - Reflecting about new weak signals in your future scenario
**Activities**: Any transformation needs to occur now already taking into account the future new normal scenario you want to achieve not the given one.

**Goals**: Reflection on two previous experiments and analyze the opportunities for reframing the future new normal that you want to achieve.

**Deliverable**: one post with new weak signals describing how the present opportunities for your project you haven’t explored before shape your future new normal. scenario

###__May 26 - Emerging Narratives
**Activities**: Outlining a clear vision for your project. Defining clear intentions and developing a clear identity.

**Goals**: Distilling the mission and vision of your project.

**Deliverable**: A communication strategy for your project.

###__June 2 - Looking forward
**Activities**: From Hyper-Local to Hyper-Global - Outlining strategies to reach interconnected global scales.

**Goals**: Reflection on the scalability of the project to other contexts.

**Deliverable**: A professional development plan for after this year of the master.

###__June 9 - Closing the Loop
**Activities**: Draft set up for the “exhibition/book/event”.

**Goals**: Prepare and define the Design Dialogues final presentation.
