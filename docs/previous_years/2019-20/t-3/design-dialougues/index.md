## Syllabus and Learning Objectives
The Design Dialogues Series will be expanded in form of various sessions with international guests along the trimester. Now, more than ever, is important to get connected to the expanded network of the Emergent Futures community, with colleagues that we admire, in order to get inspired and inspire. These series of talks revolve around how design and the designer are reinventing themselves in current times. These conversations are aimed to understand peripheral perspectives to design, at how designers, artists and researchers are dealing with the situation. Each presentation will include a pre and a post Covid-19 part to make the transition more visible to you. In this set up we encourage you to be proactive, ask questions and also share your personal experience.
