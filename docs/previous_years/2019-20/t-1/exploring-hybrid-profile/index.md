## Syllabus 

Research has shown that most of the jobs opportunities and future challenges that will arise in the next years still don’t exist. Instead of seeing it as a thread, we want you to look at it as an opportunity. An opportunity to actively create your own path, your own vision and identity rather than passively wait for what it is needed.

In MDEF we believe that learning should be driven by your motivations and not by our (the teachers) thoughts. We want you to be in control of your own development specially in a master program full of activities.
In this course, critical reflection will help you to map your strengths and weaknesses. Group discussions will make you aware about how your thinking, interests and values differ from others. By means of a series of visits to key professionals, that have undergone a shift in their careers, we want you to plan a strategic turn for yourself. We will provide you with a variety of knowledge, skills and attitudes to compare yourself with.
At the end of this course we expect you to understand who you are and what makes you unique (identity), have created a personal “vision” of your future as a professional, and a draft development plan on how to achieve it.


## Deliverables

In this course personal and group reflections are key, that is why we expect you to deliver a series of notes and conclusions from each activity. We want you to post them in your personal blog daily so other students can see them too. The final result should be a text relating your current identity as a designer, your vision of the future, and a personal development plan for the master (and beyond).
