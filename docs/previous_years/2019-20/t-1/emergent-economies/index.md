## Syllabus 

Capitalism has been or is the leading economic system and the way of understanding business and how the three sectors (Public, Private and Civil) interact. Money makes the world go round. If we want to Design the Emergent Future, we need to understand how entities (humans and businesses) interact, record transactions and how the economy is influenced by private ownership, behaviour, expectations, markets and rules. Students will briefly go thru the recent history of Macro Economics and discuss Classical Economy, Keynesian Economics to understand how we ended with overwhelmed governments and international institutions discussing, QE, tariffs, migration policies and SDG’s. The first unit will finish with a brief introduction to Micro Economics where students will discuss opportunity costs, elasticity, markets, pricing & competition. The second part will be explaining the basic accounting equation and the dual entry principle. What do Financial Statements tell us and what are their shortcomings? In this unit the course provides a deep enough understanding of assets, liabilities & equity. What are the basic rules behind the so called ‘business language’? The fundamentals of the Balance Sheet, the Income Statement and the Cash Flow Statement will be explained and discussed. The last unit of the course will be around Time in the broader sense: Where are we as human kind at the beginning of the XXI Century?

• Debt: Public & Private

• Time Preference

• Accelerating Business Growth

• Derivatives

All together the Learning Objectives are to arm the students with basic understanding and tools on where we are, how we got here and what can be done to design the imminent future in a more sustainable environment conducting business and transacting goods or services for equivalent resources or money. Among these objectives students will find:

• Understand and criticize the most important economic theories

• Appreciate the importance of the Supply and Demand model

• Identify the economic issues and point out possible solutions

• Generate awareness how business transactions affect the element of the accounting equation

• Explain how economies of scale can reduce unit costs

It is essential to know the main existing blockchain networks and their associated cryptocurrencies or tokens. In this course we will further analyse the concept of token and ICO, in addition to studying the different types of existing tokens.
