## Syllabus
According to experts, we lost the battle with climate change between 1979 and 1989. Even a decade before, the Club of Rome was already aware of the systemic problems of the model of development of the global economy, and in the voracity of consumption. Designers have been voices that always brought optimism to the discussion, beyond politicians. In 2004 designer Bruce Mau produced an exhibition and book on the topic “Massive Change”, where seemed to be a glimpse of hope based on the new perspective of starting a century and a millennium. Almost 15 years later, nations got together to declare the war on climate change, the Paris Declaration took the covers of main media around the world. Nothing seems to change: fracking is a practice that is being increased, the poles are melting, and we are extinguishing animal species at a rate never seen before.

This course is intended to help students framing research questions in an age of massive change and constant uncertainty. The sessions organized with experts are aimed to give students the framework to understand the resistance to change in society and find ways to overcome them.

During Week 5 we want to review the world crisis, from the perspective of experts that have produced work on climate change, the relationship between humans and technology, or just about the definition of humans. Students will be encouraged to find the new glimpses of hope in the current state of affairs in the world and will be guided to define their space of intervention. The course will be organized in sessions led by the Research Studio and MDEF directors.
