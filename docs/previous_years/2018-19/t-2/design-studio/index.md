## Syllabus

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take research areas of interest and initial project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Research Studio: Analyzing the past. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest.

**TERM 2 Design**:  Design Studio: Forming the present. Building the foundations. Applying knowledge into practice. Prototyping and experimenting.

**TERM 3 Development**:  Development Studio: Defining the future. Establishing roadmaps. Forming partnerships. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.
MDEFâ€™s Design Studio aims to evolve the work developed by students during the first term of the Master program (Research Studio). After identifying areas of interest, and proposing initial project ideas, students will be encouraged to develop further their projects into specific proposals, focusing on designing interventions in the real world. The studio will be supported seminars (or tracks), including the Fab Academy course, Material Driven Design, Reflection through making, and the Atlas of the Weak Signals (definition, and development).

The Design Studio time will be dedicated to supporting students to focus their work on the development of their design intervention or project. During the studio, studio leaders will bring invited guests to introduce topics of interest to the process and to participate in tutorials during the desk crits.
