## Syllabus

We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces who’s underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design.

Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world.

We will use tools such as Arduino, Raspberry Pis and Python as an introduction to the work you will later develop during the Fabacademy course.

## Deliverables

All the electronics materials as development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the workshop. However, we encourage those already owning an Arduino Kit, a Raspberry Pi, etc. to bring it.

Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers…

Do you have any old appliance at home you would like to take apart? Bring them, too!
