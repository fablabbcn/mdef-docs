## Syllabus 

The course explores the development of artificial intelligence and its close connection with design from its very beginning. We will delve into the concepts of design that exist in AI and will connect them with their implications and their possibilities as guidelines for emergent design. In this process we will explore: the autonomization of the object, the collective dimension of intelligent behaviour and the challenges that they pose for established design methods.

## Deliverables

The format of your work is quite open. Use the one that feel comfortable to express what you need to share: text, video, software, object, performance…
