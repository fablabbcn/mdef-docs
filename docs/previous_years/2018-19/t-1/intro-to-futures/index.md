## Syllabus

**Introduction to Futures Studies and Futures Thinking**

The future is currently near of being a new buzzword. The media is full of narratives of futuristic utopias and distopias, usually techno-centered. But the future is not a classic Fate. The Future, in fact, doesnâ€™t exist. That means that the future is actually a set of probabilities and possibilities. Creatives, designers, policy-makers and agents of change have an agency on it This course introduces students of the Master DfEF to Futures Theory and Futures Thinking as a set of tools and as a conceptual field subject of interest within different areas and trends of design, such as Strategic Design or Critical Design. This course also includes theoretical introductions at the most relevant foresight frameworks for designers and agents of change, a reframe on futures conception and a set of tools which will link with other courses of the master. The students will reach a more critical futures-oriented mindset, needed for developing different alternative scenarios
