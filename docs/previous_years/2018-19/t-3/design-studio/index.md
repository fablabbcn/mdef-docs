**TERM 1 Research**: Research Studio: Analyzing the past. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest.

**TERM 2 Design**: Design Studio: Forming the present. Building the foundations. Applying knowledge into practice. Prototyping and experimenting. Prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Development Studio: Defining the future. Establishing roadmaps. Forming partnerships. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

The Design Studio time will be dedicated to supporting students to focus their work on the development of their design intervention or project. During the studio, studio leaders will bring invited guests to introduce topics of interest to the process and to participate in tutorials during the desk crits.
