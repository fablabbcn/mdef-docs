## Syllabus

What futures do we want to remember by 2050? What stories do we need to imagine collectively today to be able to shape better tomorrows 1 billion seconds from now? In fact, what is a billion? How can a thought experiment as reimagining the meaning the internet(s) and thinking of it in plural, empower us and change the way we relate between humans, non-humans and with the Planet? What if we start thinking of ourselves as internet citizens rather than internet users?

In this course, participants will work in collaborative ways to design fictional narratives around the concept of internet citizenships and post-technological futures, integrating their final projects and research insights, using as a 1 billion second time horizon together with key insights from the research themes that IAM has been exploring in the last years, in particular from 2019’s theme: The Quantumness of Archipelagos, a ‘what if?’ remix of ideas coming from philosophy, geography, queer theory and quantum physics, shaped as an experimental thinking tool to deal with the complexity of our realities and a lens through which we can imagine alternatives, collectively.

The course will run as an experimental studio during 12 hours (split into 4 sessions), where participants will need self-organise to achieve a collective goal, refine the key questions shaping their projects, practice consensus, reflection, self-grading and shared learnings that will inform the individual projects and also the group performance. The main goal of this format is not only the quality of the final output but most importantly the collective learnings from running a studio, working in collaborative ways and developing interconnected mindsets around three main ideas: critical optimism, long-term strategies and planetary narratives.
