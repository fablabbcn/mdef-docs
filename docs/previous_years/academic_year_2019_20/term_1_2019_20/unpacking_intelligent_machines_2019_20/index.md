# Unpacking Intelligent Machines

An introduction to physical computing by hacking everyday objects

![](images/image_1.jpg)


## Faculty
Guillem Camprodon and Victor Barberan


## Syllabus & Schedule

We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces who’s underlying technology we hardly understand not merely due to their complexity but also because they were intended to be closed by design.

Through the idea of hacking, we will explore the internal components building everyday objects, from coffee machines to wi-fi networks, while learning how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way they work and interface with the world.

We will use tools such as Arduino, Raspberry Pis and Python as an introduction to the work you will later develop during the Fabacademy course.


## Materials

All the electronics materials as development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the workshop. However, we hardly encourage those already owning an Arduino Kit, a Raspberry Pi, etc. to bring it.

Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers…

Do you have any old appliance at home you would like to take apart? Bring them, too!

## Monday: Forensics of the obsolescence

Tuesday: The right to hack

Wednesday: The cloud that wasn’t

Thursday: Making things talk

Every day from 10-14h and 15-19h (Thursday until 18:30)


## Books
Below is an eclectic list of books that range from technology criticism, design principles towards hand on guides on building hardware and software. We choose them because we love them.
