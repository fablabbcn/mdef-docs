Andrés Costa Maluk, Bachelor of Arts (U. Playa Ancha), Master of Contemporary Art (U. of Lille), and Master of Digital Art (U. Pompeu Fabra), has cultivated an artistic practice that spans various mediums and supports, aiming to establish a dialogue between materiality and the subject of each project. His research and experiments in the art world are humble attempts to understand the contemporary context that surrounds us. In his professional career, he has managed and participated in various projects related to interaction, electronics, video mapping, and web apps for clients such as the Barcelona Provincial Council and the Llum Festival, among others. He has been involved in different collective projects and cultural associations, including axolot.cat, Matics Barcelona, Ene_ene, Escalofrío (Manuel del Camp, Ramón Aldunate, and Andrés Costa), and lettercamp.org (a collaboration between Dimitri Vazemsky and Escalofrío collective).
