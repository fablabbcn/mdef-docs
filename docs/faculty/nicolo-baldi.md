Nicolò Baldi is an interdisciplinary designer and artist born in bologna in 1999. coming from a scientific background and later graduated in industrial product design in 2023 at university of bologna, he has progressively researched a dynamic dialogue between art and science.

Contamination by different disciplines and not belonging to a mother field give him a hybrid profile where exploration is wandering and dialysis is open.

He is currently based in barcelona where he just completed a master in design for emergent futures.
