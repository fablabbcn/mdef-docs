## Syllabus

Fab Labs and advanced manufacturing infrastructure are making accessible for any citizen to make anything anywhere while sharing it with global networks of knowledge, which allows accelerating design, development and deployment processes for new products to be born. Traditional planning and urbanism are being disrupted by the acceleration of technology and the dynamic transformation of society during the last half century; it is important to rethink how we make things and why, and generate active and practical conversations through projects and prototypes that become manifests itself.

Bits<>Atoms is a practical and intensive one-week training program and a broad-reaching introduction to the Fab Lab environment. It has been designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience during Fab Academy.

During this workshop, we will be going over the basic skills needed to design, develop and fabricate almost anything in a Fab Lab, as well as how to manage the resources necessary to its proper operation.

Our active learning methodology is based on the practice of small exercises, designed to encourage the creativity and imagination of the participants, as well as stimulate the search for tools and solutions for their correct definition.

The week provides the tools and skills for launching your ideas into the future of digital fabrication and distributed manufacturing. We will offer an impact experience, seeking to inspire and motivate the participants to use the possibilities of digital manufacturing and technologies to prototype, design, fabricate and program an “honest” mechanical artefact that “makes” something.

## Deliverables

“honest” mechanical artifact (1 input + 2 output + replicable + 2 differents fabrication process)
