## Syllabus

Multimodal Systemic Artifacts are tangible creations that function as active nodes within a dynamic ecosystem, integrating multiple channels of perception and responseâ€”including analog, biological, and digital modalities
These artifacts embody closed-loop loops of sensing, interpretation, and actuation, fostering emergent behaviors, collective learning, and sustainable innovation across interconnected systems.


**These are intensive weeks to design and produce Prototype / Artifacts that will directly feed into MDEFest by providing engaging, handsâ€‘on demonstrations and interactive experiences showcasing the research projects you arew working**


### Key Elements

Duration: 30 hours in total.
- 12 hours of autonomous work (o.w.).
- 2 hours of Final presentation (f.p.).

Working format: Individual or in groups

Documentation and dissemination:
- Each team member must create a post to share insights.
- And a repository (Repo) to store and document their process and outcomes.

## Keywords
Prototyping, Co-creation, Iterative Design, Digital Fabrication, Open Source Documentation, Collaboration, Critical Making, Intervention Design, Systems Thinking, Experiential Learning, Problem-Solving


## Schedule

## Deliverables / Outputs
At the end of the Microchallenge, students must submit two key deliverables to document their learning and project development:

**Individual Post**

Each student will write a reflective post based on personal questions, capturing their learning experiences and individual contributions to the challenge. This will serve as a self-assessment and a way to share insights with the broader community.

**Project Repository**

Each group must create a new repository to document the entire development process of their intervention. This will include research, prototypes, iterations, and final outcomes. **The repository should be hosted on Hackster.io**

### Submission Deadline:
All documentation must be submitted by Monday after the challenge week to ensure proper reflection and sharing of the process.

## Evaluation Strategies 

- Only the documentation into their webpages will be taken in account for evaluation.
- The weekly standards and grading will be presented during the weekly classes.

The assessment of the MDEFest farbication Challenge is based on four key areas, ensuring a balance between selfevaluation rigor, documentation quality, engagement, and creativity.

- SYSTEMIC DEPTH (30%) â€“ Extending the projectâ€™s meaning through its systemic awareness.
- Open Content (35%) â€“ Evaluates the clarity and detail of documentation, including media such as photos, videos, and text.
- Involvement (30%) â€“ Measures attitude, motivation, and proactive behaviors throughout the process.
- Explosion (5%) â€“ A playful yet impactful category rewarding boldness and innovationâ€”as long as it does not literally explode! ðŸš€

**FINAL GRADE = 20% Individual Post (Personal Reflection) + 80% Microchallenges Average**

## Materials Needs 

All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the classes. Bring in your laptop with the proper software installed prior to the class if required (emails will be sent prior to the classes regarding this aspect).
