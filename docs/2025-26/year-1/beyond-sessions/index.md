## Syllabus

The *Beyond Sessions* is a cycle of lectures and talks featuring international guest speakers who are experts in various fields, organized throughout the academic year for master's students in Elisava's Beyond programs. Each master's program opens certain masterclasses from its curriculum to students from other Beyond programs, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and a shared calendar of talks. Topics range from speculative product design to artistic research, from architecture to activism.
Each of the guest speakers is invited on the premise that their career experience and point of view will expand student’s worldview and add unexpected ideas and fresh resources to their conceptual toolbox. At the same time, it will be an opportunity to share with other students with diverse backgrounds and interests. A cross-pollination exercise between the Masters in Critical Design, Data Design, Beyond Branding, Design for Responsible AI, Design Through New Materials, Beyond Products and Design for Emergent Futures that will expand students' experience beyond the conventional boundaries of our fields.

### Learning objectives

By the end of the Beyond Masterclass Series, students are expected to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**  
   Students will develop the ability to integrate knowledge from diverse fields such as design, communication, architecture, industrial design engineering, art, and innovation. This will be achieved through exposure to expert perspectives across these disciplines during lectures and discussions.

2. **Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving**  
   Students will enhance their critical thinking and problem-solving skills by analyzing complex concepts presented by international experts. These skills will be developed through reflective activities, engaging in Q&A sessions, and connecting theory to practice.

3. **Innovative Thinking and Creative Exploration**  
   Students will foster innovative thinking by being exposed to cutting-edge ideas and creative processes from experts in different fields. They will be encouraged to apply these insights to their own projects, pushing the boundaries of their creative and design capabilities.

4. **Networking and Professional Growth**  
   Students will expand their professional network by connecting with international experts and peers from other master’s programs. This objective will be developed through opportunities for direct interaction with guest speakers and collaborative learning with fellow students.

5. **Lifelong Learning and Global Awareness**  
   Students will embrace a mindset of lifelong learning and adaptability, understanding the importance of staying up-to-date with emerging trends and technologies in a fast-evolving world, learning how these factors influence design and innovation. This will be cultivated through ongoing engagement with forward-thinking content delivered by the masterclass series.
