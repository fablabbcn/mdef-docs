## Syllabus

This immersive short course introduces students to the intersection of biology, material science, and design. Participants will engage in hands-on explorations of bioplastics, mycelium, and bioluminescent organisms, investigating how natural processes can inspire sustainable material creation and innovative design practices. The course bridges theoretical insights with practical techniques, fostering a deeper understanding of biofabrication and its potential for reshaping design paradigms.


## Learning Objectives
- Explore the properties and applications of bio-based materials, including bioplastics, mycelium, and bacterial cellulose.
- Gain hands-on experience in crafting materials using both hot and cold recipes, such as gelatine, sodium alginate, and bioresins.
- Understand non-academic research methodologies in bio-design through interactive sessions with experts.
- Develop an awareness of biohacking and its potential for sustainable innovation.
- Investigate the philosophical and ethical dimensions of "beyond human design" by exploring symbiotic systems and living materials.



**Keywords: Bio-design, Biofabrication, Sustainable Materials, Beyond Human Design, Biohacking, Symbiosis**


## Schedule

**The following timetable is provisional and may undergo modifications and adaptations during the course.**

### Day 1: Crafted Materials - Bioplastics
- Introduction to bio-design and crafting materials.
- Hands-on workshops creating bioplastics using hot (gelatine, agar agar, starch, bioresin) and cold (sodium alginate) recipes.

### Day 2: Beyond Human Design (Wetlab)
- Advanced exploration of living systems, including slime mold and bioluminescent bacteria.
- Inspirational talks and masterclasses with invited experts (online or in person).
- Optional activity: 3D printing with biomaterials.

### Day 3: Growing Materials & Non-Academic Research (S-biotica)
- Exploration of living materials: mycelium fungi, and bacterial cellulose (kombucha).
- Insights into non-academic research approaches in bio-design.


## Materials

All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the classes. Bring in your laptop with the proper software installed prior to the class if required (emails will be sent prior to the classes regarding this aspect).


## Deliverables
