## Syllabus

Students will explore four distinct situated design practices. The course offers two complementary levels of exploration: one focused on geographical contexts and the other driven by community engagement. While these approaches can be examined separately, their materiality and meaning often intersect. The course invites students to discover, visit, and contextualize various metropolitan areas of Barcelona. Through this journey, we will delve into their unique identities, historical narratives, and contemporary realities. Students will engage with local communities involved in diverse professional and personal practices. We will also foster connections with artists, lawyers, journalists, and niche internet personalities to better understand how communities emerge or are shaped—whether recognized or hidden, institutionalized or marginalized, celebrated or stigmatized.

The artistic practice of Mario Santamaría studies the phenomenon of the contemporary observer, paying attention to two processes, the representational practices and the machine's vision or mediation. Using different tactics such as appropriation, remake or assembly, his work involves different fields like the conflict, the memory, the virtuality or the surveillance.
