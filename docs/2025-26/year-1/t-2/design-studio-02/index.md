## Syllabus

**Design Studio I - Embodied Criticism**

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take areas of research, interests and/or initial project ideas into an advanced stage of the research, with an execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Embodied Criticism**

**TERM 2 Problematize**

**TERM 3 Develop**

**Keywords: Critical Design, Problematization, Ethics of Design, AV Narratives, Materiality, Spatial Infrastructures, Territoriality, Research Entanglements, Situated Practice, Power Structures, Alternative Presents**


## Learning Objectives

The specific goals are the following

1.	Critically interrogate personal assumptions, research entanglements, and ethical positions shaping the project.
2.	Develop situated analytical skills by problematizing narratives, objects, materialities, and spatial infrastructures.
3.	Engage critically with contexts and communities, understanding the geopolitical, ecological, and technoscientific forces that condition design interventions.
4.	Assemble and articulate a coherent set of problematizations—statements, AV narratives, objects, and spatial artifacts—demonstrating accountable and reflexive design practice.
5.	Reflect on how design enacts alternative presents, exposing power structures while proposing more responsible modes of intervention.


## Schedule

PROBLEMATIZE guides students through a staged interrogation of their projects—ethical, narrative, material, and spatial—toward more critical, situated, and accountable design interventions. The course begins with an examination of personal biases and research entanglements through errors and fascinations, followed by a deeper inquiry into the ethical implications of each project across scales from self to planet. Narrative then becomes a method for revealing complexity, culminating in a concise AV piece that maps conceptual, contextual, and affective dimensions.

As the course progresses, the focus expands to the material and political lives of objects, examining their embedded power structures through design and critical inquiry. This leads into spatial problematization, where students analyze infrastructures, territorialities, and geopolitical forces shaping their work. Through iterative reviews, students assemble a curated constellation of statements, narratives, objects, and spatial artifacts in preparation for the Design Dialogues exhibition.


=== "12/01"

    **DS02 Introduction. Why to Problematize?**

    **Goals:** Critically look back at your project, reflect on the feedback from the Design Dialogues, and propose a new scope, goals and next steps.

    **Activity:** Briefly present in class Artifact–Statement–AV Narrative, presented in the Design Dialogues + a summary of the most relevant feedback received.

    **Assignment:** Reflect on your and your project’s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back. Analyze your so-called “failures” as opportunities for redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project accordingly. 

    **Deliverable:** Problematize Yourself: present yourself with 5 errors + 5 fascinations (based on all your creative process till the moment).


=== "19/01"

    **20/01 Problematize Yourself. Guests: [Toni Llàcer](https://www.elisava.net/en/teaching-staff/toni-llacer-phd/)**
    

    **Goals:** 
-	Emphasize the importance of rigor and depth in design research to inform interventions.
-	Introduce methods for collecting, analyzing, and organizing data to strengthen research outcomes.
-	Highlight strategies for linking insights to actions, ensuring research is actionable and grounded in real-world contexts.
-	Foster critical reflection on the research process, encouraging students to question assumptions and biases.
Activity: Briefly present in class Problematize Myself: 5 errors + 5 fascinations. Feedback by Toni Llàcer.

    **Activity:** Briefly present in class Problematize Myself: 5 errors + 5 fascinations. Feedback by Toni Llàcer.

    **Assignement:** Problematize all the ethical entanglements of your project. What ethics do your project enact consciously? What ethics do your project enact unconsciously? 

    **Deliverable:** Problematize Ethics: write a list of at least 4 major ethical problems, based on the following scales Me– My Community–Society–Planet.

    **Goals:**

    - Emphasize the importance of rigor and depth in design research to inform interventions.
    - Introduce methods for collecting, analyzing, and organizing data to strengthen research outcomes.
    - Highlight strategies for linking insights to actions, ensuring research is actionable and grounded in real-world contexts.
    - Foster critical reflection on the research process, encouraging students to question assumptions and biases.

    **Activity:**

    TBD

    **Task:** 

    - Plan and execute a design intervention using the opportunity given with the micro challenge, to use research insights to inform the approach.
    - Document and analyze the intervention, focusing on how research guided the decisions and outcomes.

    **Deliverable 1:**

    *One step further than the video: Intervention Report*

    A detailed document that includes:

    - Research methods used.
    - Key findings and insights.
    - Analysis of how findings influenced the design intervention.
    - Reflection on what worked, what didn’t, and areas for improvement.

    **Deliverable 2:**

    *Updated Design Space*: Visual or conceptual updates based on new findings and relationships built during the intervention.

=== "17/02"

    **The Ethics of Making: Accountability in Design Practices - Toni Navarro y Alejandra Lopez Gabrieliris**

    **Goals**:

    - Explore the ethical dimensions of design and its impact on emergent futures.
    - Develop a critical perspective as a foundational skill for analyzing and questioning assumptions, frameworks, and contexts.
    - Emphasize the importance of commitment and thoroughness in the design process, highlighting accountability and sustained effort.
    - Equip students with tools to integrate ethics into their interventions, ensuring designs advocate for equity, sustainability, and resilience.

    **Activity**: TBD

    **Task**:

    - Develop a short manifesto or set of principles outlining your ethical commitments as a designer.
    - Reflect on your current project, identifying areas where ethical considerations can be strengthened or reframed.

## Grading Method

| Percentage  | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------            |
| 50%         | Faculty (including written assignment)          |
| 50%         | Self-Evaluation                                 |

Self-Evaluation Question: Look back at the interventions you did last term and analyze them by self-evaluating your development:

- How much have you involved your community through your design interventions?
- Did your process involve others in the design and implementation of the interventions? How meaningful do you think the interventions were for the external people that were involved?
- In terms of situating your interventions, how successful were you in considering the resilience, material flows, situated knowledges and existing infrastructures in your design process?
- Were you able to draft an alternative present through the iterative reflective process offered by the outcomes of your design interventions?
