## Syllabus

**Design Studio I - Embodied Criticism**

MDEF Research, Design and Development studios aim to take areas of research, interests and/or initial project ideas into an advanced stage of the research, with an execution plan. The studio structure in three terms could be understood as follows:

**TERM 1 Research**: Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. We achieve this by analyzing the past, finding weak signals, analyzing references and the current state of the art and identifying each one's areas of interest. All of this investigation occurs through experimenting from the first-person perspective.

**TERM 2 Design**: Forming the present through interventions in the real world. Building the foundations of your design space, forming strategic partnerships. Applying knowledge into practice through iterative prototyping. Testing ideas and prototypes in the real world.

**TERM 3 Development**: Refining interventions and identifying desirable futures/alternative presents. Establishing roadmaps for the construction of alternative narratives. Communicating and disseminating your project through speculative design.

The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Weekly activities will be set to interlink results from the courses like their mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1st person design activities, prototypes, with their personal development plan. In order to propose an area of intervention at the end of the trimester. The Design Studio activities will consist of presentations, group activities, short exercises and personal coaching. 

**Keywords: Prototyping, 1st Person Research through Design, Design Space, Documentation and Communication, Design Interventions**

### Learning Objectives

The specific goals are the following: 
1. To develop a critical position within the student’s design practice.
2. Define possible areas of intervention, based on the Atlas of the Week Signals.
3. Generate design spaces which allows to prototype with context, direction  and understanding.
4. To build personal and collective repositories of resources.


## Schedule

 **Schedule**: Each session will start with a 90-minutes presentation of the previous exercise and feedback.

=== "02/10"

    **Landing Kick off - Collective Map of Individual Ref-Points**

     **Goals**: To cross affectivity, situated criticality and site-specific sensitivity in order to define a series of referential places, which define you as a political, social and creative being. 
     
     **Activity**: Map 10 different places from your "techno-bio-physical-social" environment 
with a special importance for your creative agency. Work in the collective map interface previously delivered to all the students.

    **Deliverable**: 10 geo-located points in the collective map of ref-points: each point has to be labeled with a specific title and description according to the previously determined graphic code. Prepare a short (up to 5mins) presentation showing the 5 most important points.

=== "06/10"

    **Embodied Criticism I: Position Yourself**

    **Class**: Critical Perspectives (situatedness and contextuality, revision of theoretical and practical framework) Climatic Justice/ Decolonial theories and necropolitics/ Queer Failure and speculative feminism.

    **Activity**: 
    1/ Choose a context of interest (socio-bio-techno-political, both physical and/or digital, etc.). Develop a site-specific research methodology to study this context from a 1PP approach.
    2/ Write a manifest: what do you care about, what drives you crazy, what makes you dream, etc.)

    **Deliverable**: 
    1/ Choose a context of interest (socio-bio-techno-political, both physical and/or digital, etc.). Develop a site-specific research methodology to study this context from a 1PP approach.
    2/ Write a manifest: what do you care about, what drives you crazy, what makes you dream, etc.)

=== "20/10"

    **Embodied Criticism II: Prototype an action**

    **Class**: Performative criticality: embodied actions of resistance and desire (Architecture of Action: Syntax of six typologies of actions).

    **Activity**:
    1/ Prototype an embodied action of resistance and/ or desire. 
    2/ Test at least three different prototypes. 
    3/ Study their interrelationship with the context. What do they enact? Transformations, errors, exceptions.

    **Deliverable**: Document your first prototypes based on the following index of contents:
    - Conceptual Definition: 150w. context to intervene, problematics, potentials, objectives, etc.
    - 3 x Hypothesis: design and develop at least three different hypothesis based on the conceptual statement
    - 3 x Prototypes: audiovisual documentation of the prototypes’ development + critical evaluation

=== "03/11"

    **Embodied Criticism III: Act Individually**

    **Class**: Protocols for critical actions. Critical engagement with plural contexts. Site-specificity and institutional critique. Guest lecturer: [Luz Broto]([/assets/images/2023-24/year-1/t-1/design-studio-01-6-design-strategies.png](https://luzbroto.net/))

    **Activity**: Develop a protocol for an individual action. Perform it. Document it.

    **Deliverable**:  
    1/ Detailed protocol per steps and phases
    2/ Audiovisual documentation of the implementation: context activation, ad-hoc designed and developed artifacts, process documentation (develop a proper methodology for systematic documentation) 


=== "17/11"

    **Embodied Criticism III: Act collectively**

    **Class**: Multiscalar collective practices of wellbeing and resistance. Guest Lecturer: [La Cuarta Piel](https://lacuartapiel.com/)

    **Activity**: Create a relationship of trust of a specific collective of interest (human, non-human, physical, digital, etc.). Develop a protocol for collective action. Perform it. Document it.

    **Deliverable**: 
    1/ Detailed protocol per steps and phases
    2/ Activation of an affective relationship to a collective of interest: why this community, how do you contribute, why do they need your activation, what are your collective objectives (not only yours)
    3/ Audiovisual documentation of the implementation: context activation, ad-hoc designed and developed artifacts, process documentation (develop a proper methodology for systematic documentation) 


=== "01/12"

    **Design Dialogues Preparation**

    **Goals**: Create a collective and individual building up plan for the Design Dialogues exhibition.

    **Activity**: Group dynamic to create themes and groups of projects for the exhibition.

    **Deliverable 1**: Planning of the exhibition, space allocation and special needs.

    **Deliverable 2**: Work on the Design Dialogues deliverables.


=== "15/12"

    **Design Dialogues**

    **Goals**: to present collective areas of intervention and to present the first experiments at a personal and collective level, and in an immediate context. To produce the first group exhibition of the master’s projects.

    **Deliverables**: 
    1/ A series of prototypes presented in a collective design space and a personal video of no more than 3 minutes (answering the question what is your updated purpose). 
    2/ 5 high resolution images of the highlights of your Design Studio work during the term, a high resolution image of your personal and collective design space and the first chapters of your Publication which represent each one of the deliverables developed during the term.

## Deliverables

**Deliverables for after the holidays (Submission deadline, January 7th)**

- **5 high resolution images** of the **highlights of your Design Studio work** during the term
- **1 high resolution image** of your **personal and collective design space**
- **First chapter of your Publication** (TBD)

- Relevance of the project in relation to the weak signals
- Framing of the opportunity through the Collective Design Space
- Involvement of the community through the collective interventions
