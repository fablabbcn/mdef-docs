## Syllabus

Students will be introduced to practical first-person design methodologies by living with their own ideas. Following a series of introductory texts by a diverse group of researchers, thinkers, artists and makers such as Marshal McLuhan, Haila Koskela, Sandy Stone, Donna Haraway, Sophie Cale and Jill Magid, students will be encouraged to develop and embody a series of prostheses iterations under their own agency and rationale. The final delivery comprises a short documentary or article, besides all the developed prototypes and prostheses. The course includes lectures and Q&A’s by **Saúl Baeza**, **Thomas Twaites** and **Manuel De Aguas**.

**Keywords: Self, Agency, Surveillance, Identity, Prototyping, Discipline, Desire**
