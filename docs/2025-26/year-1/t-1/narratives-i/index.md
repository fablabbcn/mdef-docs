## Syllabus

This short course will delve into the importance of narratives and storytelling when explaining our projects, which often include complex and abstract information that the general public finds difficult to relate to. We will create a space to discuss and exercise judgment in the face of new, rapidly developing tools such as Natural Language Processors, and we will seek to define and, of course, draft our manifesto, which will serve as our roadmap throughout the course.

**Keywords: Storytelling, narratives, writing**

### Learning Objectives

- We will discover narratives as stories we tell ourselves to give meaning, value and significance to our projects.
- We will use storytelling as an ancient human tool.
- We will understand basic ideas about how to interact and connect with the audience.
- We will create a thread that guides our research so that it has a solid narrative.

## Schedule

    **MANIFESTO**

    We will create a text that will serve as a personal and professional positioning statement and as a personal manifesto for our practice.

    **NARRATIVE**

    We will work on a document that structures the evolution of our positioning and research.

    **THE PROPOSAL and SCRIPTS**
