## Syllabus

The course aims to fill knowledge gaps in digital fabrication and physical computing while fostering critical reflection about how technologies are designed, used, and reimagined.

This two-week intensive program combines critical exploration of everyday technologies with the creative fabrication of useless machines.

It is structured in two main parts:

* **Part I: Unpacking Intelligent Machines** – An introduction to physical computing through hacking and dissecting everyday objects.
* **Part II: The Machine Paradox (The Almost Useful Machines – TAUMS)** – A speculative exercise in designing and fabricating mechanical artifacts that embrace contradictions, randomness, and existential absurdity.

### Part I: Unpacking Intelligent Machines

*An introduction to physical computing by hacking everyday objects*

We spend our lives interacting with objects and interfaces whose underlying technology we hardly understand—not merely due to their complexity but because they were intentionally designed to be closed systems. 
Through hacking practices, students will explore and dissect the internal components of common objects (from coffee machines to wi-fi routers), learning how to use open software and hardware tools to reprogram, reconfigure, and redesign the way these objects interact with the world. 

#### Focus: 
* Reverse-engineering & forensic exploration 
* Understanding system components (mechanical, electronic, digital) ● Rewiring, reprogramming, and altering functions 
* Critical reflection on openness vs. closed design

### Part II: The Machine Paradox (The Almost Useful Machines – TAUMS)

*Building contradictions, randomness, and wonderfulness*

The Machine Paradox, also known as The Almost Useful Machines (TAUMS), is a project that challenges participants to design and build "useless" machines. These machines are designed to provoke critical thinking about technology and its relationship to society. The paradox lies in using seemingly unproductive creations as tools for exploring complex concepts like technological determinism and the impact of technology on human experience.

Through the Machine Paradox, participants engage in hands-on, experimental learning that encourages a more critical and personal approach to technology.

As a metaphor, Useless Machines embody existential purity: they do not aim to solve problems or serve predefined functions. Instead, they focus on mechanics, movement, and playful actuation, free from utilitarian constraints.
By embracing endless, random, or contradictory behaviors, students will fabricate artifacts that celebrate the paradox of purposelessness—machines that are simultaneously absurd, poetic, and meaningful in their uselessness.


#### Focus:
* Reverse-engineering & forensic exploration 
* Understanding system components (mechanical, electronic, digital) ● Rewiring, reprogramming, and altering functions 
* Critical reflection on openness vs. closed design

### Learning Objectives

By the end of the program, participants will:

**Unfold the foundations of Big Tech**
- Understand systems thinking and technological architectures.
- Critically explore the politics of technology, intellectual property models, and programmed obsolescence.


**Explore emergent and alternative technologies**
- Investigate both research-driven and industry-leading innovations.
- Revisit deprecated, vernacular, analog, and not-massively-adopted technologies.
- Address technologies not only from a narrative perspective but also through application and implementation.


**Prototype technological artifacts**
- Learn tools and methods for embedding software and hardware prototypes in the design process.
- Apply rapid prototyping, physical computing, and digital fabrication.


**Engage with the Fab Lab / Maker / Hacker ecosystem**
- Familiarize with Fab Lab Barcelona’s resources, distributed design practices, open-source culture, and worldwide networks.
- Adopt a maker/hacker mindset rooted in experimentation, tinkering, and shared knowledge.


**Develop a critical, creative, and personal relationship with technology**
- Move beyond utilitarianism toward speculative and expressive approaches.
- Build “almost useful” or “useless” machines that embody contradictions and poetic value.


**Promote collaboration and collective intelligence**
Learn how to ask the right questions, exchange knowledge, and build partnerships.
Embrace the idea that no one knows everything about technology, but anyone can ask about anything.


### Materials Needs

All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the workshop.

Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers...

Do you have any old appliances (radios, toys, telephones, lamps, screens, keyboards...) at home you would like to take apart? Bring them, too! (For safety reasons, avoid choosing appliances with a lot of power or that are easily heated).

## Schedule

The course duration is a total of 32 hours of guided workshop time, spanned along two weeks.
