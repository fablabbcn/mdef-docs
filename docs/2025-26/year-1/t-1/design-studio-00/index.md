## Syllabus

This intense three-day course is focused on equipping students with the skills and knowledge to tackle the complexities of emergent challenges through alternative presents. The course is structured to provide a comprehensive base for students as they embark on their master's journey, both conceptually and physically. To do so, we will follow a series of pre-established drifts around the city of Barcelona and its surroundings, developing real time cartographies of our experiences. Making use of the tool Atlas of Weak Signals, we will explore present weak signals in order to identify strategies to anticipate emergent futures. We will map and discuss ecosystems through first-person perspective encounters, all of which will be interconnected with each student's personal perspectives.

**Keywords: Alternative Presents, Design Space, Multi-Scale Mapping, Atlas of Weak Signals, First Person Perspective, Community of Practice, Cartografies**

## Learning Objectives

1. Comprehend Social and Critical Ecologies: Understand how techno-human practices integrate into and influence social and critical ecologies, enabling the creation of alternative narratives that challenge existing paradigms.
2. Identify and Analyze Weak Signals: Get to know the methodology of the Atlas of Weak Signals to identify early indicators of change, using these signals to explore potential intervention opportunities and construct plausible future scenarios.
3. Explore and Map Socio-Technical Systems: Explore, develop, and document the relationships within socio-technical systems, fostering a holistic understanding of the interplay between designed systems and their contexts.
4. Explore and walk more than human realities in the city of Barcelona and its surroundings.

## Schedule

Oct **5th, 8th & 9th**, 2025

=== "05/10 - Cartography 1: Montjuic"

    **Activity time**: 11:00 - 17:00
    
    **Meeting point**: Font Màgica
    
    **Requirements**: Bring your lunch, a bottle of water, a smartphone (if you have one), and a notebook.    
     
    **Goals**: Students will delve into the exercise of the Atlas of Weak Signals. This methodology provides a structured framework for students, designers, and professionals across diverse fields. The Atlas aids in identifying potential intervention opportunities by collecting and organizing early indicators of change, referred to as weak signals. These signals serve as a keyword taxonomy, offering a foundation for analyzing current systems and building plausible scenarios.

    **Activity**: Building up on our collective Google Maps cartography, adding, commenting and relating our experiences. Add a new input/reaction (Image, video, short text, question, commentary…etc) every 15 minutes.

=== "08/10 - Cartography 2: Besòs River"

    **Activity time**: 9:30 - 13:30
    
    **Meeting point**: Torre de l’Aigua -TBC-
    
    **Requirements**: Bring a bottle of water, a smartphone (if you have one), and a notebook.
     
    **Goals**: To effectively interact with social and critical ecologies through a First Person Perspective (1PP), it is essential to cultivate an understanding of the tools, material elements, infrastructures, communities of practice, and social networks integral to the socio-technical system under design. The exercises in this session present both a methodology and a structured system designed to facilitate the exploration, development, and documentation of these crucial references and relationships. These activities aim to provide students with a comprehensive and insightful understanding of the intricate interplay between the designed system and its contextual elements, fostering a holistic perspective on socio-technical landscapes.

=== "09/10 - Cartography 2: IAAC Future house"

    **Activity time**: 9:30 - 11:30
    
    **Meeting point**: IAAC
    
    **Requirements**: Bring a bottle of water, a smartphone (if you have one), and a notebook.
