# Term 1


## Framing Collective Design Interventions

Understanding what it means to design for emergent futures. Analyzing the past and finding weak signals. References, state of the art. Identifying areas of interest. Experimenting from the first-person perspective. Foundational literacies of Open Source Ecosystems and Digital infrastructure, Synthetic Biology, Collective Intelligences and ML technologies and Community Engagement.

The first term aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects. Courses and Design Studio work will seek to interlink through mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1st person design activities and prototypes with their personal development plan, in order to propose areas of interest and execute a first collective design intervention at the end of the trimester.
