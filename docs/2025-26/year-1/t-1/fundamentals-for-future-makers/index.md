## Syllabus

The Fundamentals of Digital Fabrication seminar is the first contact for new MDEF students with the technologies, tools, and fabrication processes available in the lab. Over the course of nine weeks, we will introduce the main 3D design software, digital fabrication machines, basic electronics concepts, and some design and production techniques that will undoubtedly be extremely useful for developing more elaborate and meaningful projects throughout the course. Each session will also contain a complementary task that will be done in groups.

The seminar is composed of 9 sessions spread over 9 weeks. Each session includes 2,5 hours of class or project development and 4 hours of support.

**Keywords: Fabrication, Electronics, Design**

### Learning Objectives

- Familiarizing oneself with all areas of the Fabrication Lab, along with their rules and safety protocols.
- Gaining proficiency in the operation of hand tools and power tools in the Workshop area, while overcoming any hesitation in using them.
- Acquiring a foundational understanding of 2D design and 3D modeling in Fusion 360, and becoming comfortable with its interface.
- Learning the workflow of the three primary digital fabrication technologies (3D printing, laser cutting/engraving, CNC machining), along with the basic principles of their operation.
- Understanding the fundamentals of coding in C++ using Arduino IDE and creating flow diagrams.
- Identifying the Barduino Board and the key electronic components used as INPUTS and OUTPUTS.
- Applying theoretical knowledge in hands-on design and production projects.
- Developing an effective setup for Design Dialogues.

### Materials Needs

All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the workshop.

Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers...

Do you have any old appliances (radios, toys, telephones, lamps, screens, keyboards...) at home you would like to take apart? Bring them, too! (For safety reasons, avoid choosing appliances with a lot of power or that are easily heated).

## Deliverables

Students are not required to post class notes to their blogs/web. They should only upload documentation of the activities done in class (or outside) and their results. A reflection on the technologies learnt and their possible link to their project will also be required.

## Grading Method

The evaluation for this seminar will be primarily based on students' participation, attitude in class, and the content they post and document on their blogs. As the assigned tasks serve mainly as tools for learning, formal evaluation of them will be minimal, making active engagement in class the key factor for success. There wonâ€™t be a big final project to evaluate either.
