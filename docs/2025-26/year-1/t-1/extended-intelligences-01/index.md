## Syllabus

The first part of the seminar is a collaborative learning experience designed to engage participants in a critical exploration, analysis and storytelling of Artificial Intelligence systems, the main impacts of its applications and implications in design practices. Participants will decode dominant AI narratives from the perspective of Social-Ecological-Technological Systems theories and learn about the limits of digitalization and datifcation in the context of the current state of climate emergency.

The course approach combines a curated set of inputs through lectures, in-class screenings, debates and group readings alongside a design fiction lab track that enables participants to work collaboratively in small groups in a creative research experiment to digest, process and share their learnings that will be used in the second part of the seminar.

The second part of the seminar will be focused on AI and contemporary visual culture. With a practical approach, and by learning some techniques and tools, part of the concepts learnt on the first part will be applied.

A speculative experiment will be developed by the students in small groups during the seminar and will be presented at its end.


### Learning objectives

- Develop a basic and multidimensional understanding of AI, from its origins as a scientific discipline and its philosophical connotations to how AI systems work and are being used today in a wide range of contexts.
- Develop a critical understanding of the socio-economic, socio-technical, and socio-ecological aspects of AI systems, alongside the ethical, social, environmental and cultural implications emerging from their use at scale.
- Learn to use technical tools to run some AI programs.
- Understand the current proposals in designing with/for Extended Intelligence.
