## Syllabus

The Emergent Technologies course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of advanced digital fabrication techniques, with a particular focus on electronics and design. The course is based on the Fab Academy curriculum, developed by the Center for Bits and Atoms (MIT), and combines its global pedagogical framework with local, hands-on learning.

The program offers a balanced blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experience, enabling participants to develop skills across multiple domains of digital fabrication, computational design, and electronics. By the end of the course, students will have developed a robust portfolio of projects and gained a deep understanding of how to integrate emerging technologies into their design practice.

**Keywords: Documentation, Tinkering, Design, Prototyping, Digital fabrication**

### Learning Objectives

- Develop skills in electronics production and embedded programming.
- Explore advanced topics in wearable technology, soft robotics.
- Gain hands-on experience in digital fabrication techniques.
- Foster creativity and innovation through interdisciplinary experiences.


### Methodological Strategies

- **Elective Modules:** Each student must select 4 modules from a range of specialized topics, allowing them to delve deeper into areas of personal interest and relevance to their future careers.
- **Hands-on Learning:** The course emphasizes practical, hands-on workshops and projects, enabling students to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** By combining modules from different domains, the course encourages an interdisciplinary approach to design and innovation.
- **Collaborative Learning:** Students will have the opportunity to join classes with peers from different backgrounds. This collaborative environment fosters a rich exchange of ideas and perspectives, enhancing the learning experience.


### Materials Needs

All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the workshop.

Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers...


## Schedule
Students are required to select 4 elective modules from the following options:

- [Electronics Design](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html) (Wed 2026-02-25 to Wed 2026-03-04), [Electronics Production](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_production/index.html)(Wed 2026-03-11 to Wed 2026-03-18): 2 modules, need to sign up for both
- [Embedded programming](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html) (Wed 2026-02-11 to Wed 2026-02-18)
- [Networking and communications](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/index.html) (Wed 2026-04-01 to Wed 2026-04-08)
- [Molding and casting](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/molding_casting/index.html) (Wed 2026-04-22 to Wed 2026-04-29)
- [Wildcard week](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/wildcard/index.html) (Wed 2026-05-13 to Wed 2026-05-20)
- [Mechanical design, Machine design](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/machine_design/index.html) (Wed 2026-04-08 to Wed 2026-04-22) : counts as 2 modules.


For each selected module, students are required to attend (in the protolab) at minimum the following classes and complete the module assignments:

- **Local Classes:** Every Thursday and Friday from 9:30 am to 13:30 pm CET, depending on the week
- **Global Class:** Every Wednesday at 15:00 pm CET with Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Academy Global Faculty.

In addition to attending these sessions, students must actively complete all assignments and deliverables for their selected modules, **with an estimated personal dedication of at least 8 hours per week, distributed according to their individual schedules.**



## Deliverables

Students are required to:

- Document all their projects and module deliverables on their personal websites. Including:
    - Design process
    - Fabrication and design files (links)
    - Videos an pictures (also gif)
    - Reflection (failures and mistakes)
- Follow the same documentation standards as the Fab Academy program.
- Produce working prototypes and project demonstrations for each module.
- For Machine Design, students must deliver a more complex group project.

## Grading and Evaluation

Assessment is based on the timely submission and quality of the required assignments for each module.

**Submission deadline:** All assignments must be published on the project website by the following Wednesday after the end of the module.

**Late submissions:** Any deliverable submitted after this deadline will receive a penalty of –0.5 points on the module grade.

**Feedback:** Students will receive qualitative feedback during the week following the submission deadline, to support learning and improvement.
