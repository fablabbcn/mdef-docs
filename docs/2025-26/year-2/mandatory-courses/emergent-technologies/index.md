## Syllabus

The Emergent Technologies course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of advanced digital fabrication techniques, with a focus on electronics and design. This program offers a blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, enabling participants to develop their skills across multiple domains.

By the end of the program, students will have a robust portfolio of projects and a deep understanding of how to integrate technology into their design practices.

**Keywords: Documentation, Tinkering, Design, Prototyping, Digital fabrication**

### Learning Objectives

- Develop skills in electronics production and embedded programming.
- Explore advanced topics in wearable technology, soft robotics, biohacking, or skin electronics.
- Gain hands-on experience in digital fabrication techniques.
- Foster creativity and innovation through interdisciplinary experiences.


### Methodological Strategies


**Elective Modules:** Each student must select 4 modules from a range of specialized topics, allowing them to delve deeper into areas of personal interest and relevance to their future careers.

**Hands-on Learning:** The course emphasizes practical, hands-on workshops and projects, enabling students to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.

**Interdisciplinary Approach:** By combining modules from different domains, the course encourages an interdisciplinary approach to design and innovation.

**Collaborative Learning:** Students will have the opportunity to join classes with peers from different backgrounds. This collaborative environment fosters a rich exchange of ideas and perspectives, enhancing the learning experience.


### Materials Needs

All materials needed for the course will be provided by the faculty. The students are required to bring to the classes their own students toolkit and the programming boards given to them at the start of the academic year, other development boards, sensors and actuators will be provided during the workshop.

Bring in your laptop and any prototyping tools you have around such as a cutter, tape, markers, screwdrivers...

Do you have any old appliances (radios, toys, telephones, lamps, screens, keyboards...) at home you would like to take apart? Bring them, too! (For safety reasons, avoid choosing appliances with a lot of power or that are easily heated).

## Schedule
Students are required to select 4 elective modules from the following options:

- [Electronics Production](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_production/index.html)
- [Electronics design](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html)
- [Embedded programming](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html)
- [Networking and communications](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/index.html)
- [Molding and casting](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/molding_casting/index.html)
- [Wildcard week](https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/wildcard/index.html)
- [ mechanical design, machine design (2 modules)](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/machine_design/index.html)


For each selected module, students are required to attend (in the protolab) at minimum the following classes and complete the module assignments:

- **Local Classes:** Every Thursday or/and from 9:30 am to 13:30 pm CET, depending on the week
- **Global Class:** Every Wednesday at 15:00 pm CET with Neil Gershenfeld.

In addition to attending these sessions, students must actively complete all assignments and deliverables for their selected modules.


## Deliverables

Students are required to:

- Document all their projects and module deliverables on their personal websites.
- Follow the same documentation standards as the Fab Academy program.
- Produce working prototypes and project demonstrations for each module.
- For Machine Design, students must deliver a more complex group project.
