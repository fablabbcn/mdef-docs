Elective courses are complementary seminars and workshops offered to all of IAAC’s second year masters students. They cover a range of specific topics and technologies. Students create their own research agenda by selecting the elective courses that can help them gain skills and knowledge that will support their [**Thesis Project**](/2024-25/year-2/mandatory-courses/thesis-project/).

There are two types of elective courses, [**Applied Research Seminars**](/2025-26/year-2/elective-courses/applied-research) and [**Content Workshops**](/2025-26/year-2/elective-courses/content-workshops). Students are required to choose one elective from each type.
