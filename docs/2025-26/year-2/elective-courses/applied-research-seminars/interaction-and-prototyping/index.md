## Context for Llum BCN 2024

The Llum BCN festival is organised by the Barcelona Institute of Culture (ICUB). It  takes place during the month of February to coincide with the Festival de Santa Eulalia.

Llum BCN is a festival of lights. For three nights a part of the city is selected as the backdrop for light installations by professionals and academic institutions.

“The path that lightning takes not only is not predictable but does not make its way according to some continuous unidirectional path between sky and ground. Instead, lightning's becoming is one that ‘has always danced on the razor's edge between science and imagination’.” Karen Barad The city of Barcelona and the Llum Festival challenge IAAC to design an ephemeral light installation in a public square where a former electrical substation once stood. Aiming to establish a dialogue with the social and historical context of the neighborhood, IAAC’s proposal envisions a site-specific light intervention that not only illuminates the area’s industrial past but also reflects on its present urban dynamics and future challenges. The project seeks to bridge memory and innovation, highlighting the community’s ongoing efforts to enhance public spaces, while addressing critical issues such as energy transition, resource management, and environmental sustainability.
