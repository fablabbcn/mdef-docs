## Context for Llum BCN 2024

The Llum BCN festival is organised by the Barcelona Institute of Culture (ICUB). It  takes place during the month of February to coincide with the Festival de Santa Eulalia.

Llum BCN is a festival of lights. For three nights a part of the city is selected as the backdrop for light installations by professionals and academic institutions.
