## Syllabus

*How to evaluate business opportunities and build scalable ventures*

In an ever-changing world, where the speed of innovation and the amount of external forces and drives is constantly growing, the capability to quickly evaluate opportunities and innovate is paramount for the creation of successful businesses.

The Business Innovation Seminar is designed to provide students from architecture and design backgrounds the key understanding of what makes a project a viable business idea, how to analyze markets and industries, how to validate ideas early on and how to iterate and innovate on business models to build the basis for an economically sustainable venture. Based on the Lean Methodology and mixing together theory, real-life examples, practical exercises and 1-1 feedback, it gives students a toolbox and a mental mindset to approach opportunities during their professional careers as well as the foundations to set up a business.

All the content will be directly applied by students on a final Venture Starting Package, that will be presented during a final pitch.
