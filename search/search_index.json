It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges.</p> <p>The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students\u2019 own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times.</p> <p>Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging.</p> <p>The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention\u2019, that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture.</p> <p>Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty.</p> <p>The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015. MDEF is dedicated to scaling up the impact of maker practices and reimaging how design can be central to enacting a paradigm shift towards preferred plural futures.</p>"},{"location":"2018-19/t-1/","title":"Term 1","text":"<p>The program has four conceptual pillars:</p>"},{"location":"2018-19/t-1/#instrumentation","title":"Instrumentation","text":"<p>Students learn a modular set of maker skills and tools and how these can be used in the design process to translate their ideas into prototypes and prototypes into products.

A crisis that is not only environmental but also political and economic, being determined by the route of the Paris Agreement, an unprecedented historical project spanning decades. And above all, because it is also a philosophical crisis, that of the project of recomposing our vision of the relationship between culture and nature, a relationship that has changed without the possibility of turning back.</p> <p>A crisis of the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years: neoliberalism, which today is unable to guarantee the welfare of contemporary societies, destabilized by precariousness and inequality. And the emerging stories about a next model, still discontinuous and tentative, that begin to articulate around the notion of postcapitalism.</p> <p>Multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, which have opened a gap between institutional politics and citizenship, creating a space of opportunity for which new political movements with multiple origins struggle: from activism and grassroots social movements, to media populisms or the xenophobic reactionary movements. Together with these, a crisis of the global geopolitical order, which is once again dominated by the tension between poles. And of course, a crisis of the nation-state of the twentieth century, which is fragmented in search of other possible configurations for the 21st century.</p> <p>A crisis of the discourses of the most recent utopia, the digital utopia, and of the visions that found in technological innovation the answer and the cure to all the other crises. The technological regime of the last 15 years has ceased to be perceived as an unequivocal force of progress, and citizens begin to distrust some actors, the giants of Silicon Valley, who have perfected new and disturbing mechanisms of exploitation, eroding the fabric of our societies.</p> <p>A crisis of the productive model and the nature of work in the face of the growing development of automation and robotization and Artificial Intelligence. A crisis that places nation-states in direct conflict with new agents, whose impact and ability to influence rivals that of governments. And in which new imaginaries emerge about what a world would look like after work, and horizons like the myth of the Universal Basic Income</p> <p>A crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business. The thrust of alternative stories and the active mobilization of a multiplicity of collectives \u2014from women and migrants to the LGTBQI collective\u2014 calls for a more diverse society, with a more equitable distribution of power.</p> <p>A migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply, and in which protectionist speeches return and barriers are raised again.</p> <p>These vectors, and some others, define the territory in which we build our collective projects and our hopes for collective development.

It has been a trajectory that has taken us from traditional crafts where the designer and the maker were the same person, to a predominantly digital design process that is almost entirely based on concepts, form and theory and where the product development and fabrication are left in the hands of others.</p> <p>But, making is back. Digital fabrication tools are engaging people in the process of designing and making physical objects in all parts of the world. Still, in the historical journey of design changing from analogue to digital and from the hands to the head, the in-depth knowledge of materials and how work with them, have been pushed out. This knowledge gap represents a major issue when designing sustainable physical objects (and in many other aspects). The main reason being that up to 80%of sustainability impacts are decided at the product design stage (Kulatunga et al., 2015; Lewis, Gertsakis, Grant, Morelli, &amp; Sweatman, 2017). This effectively means that the designer is the creator of a recipe and will unavoidably make decisions that follow the product through its lifecycle. Therefore, the aim of this course is to bring the material dialogue which distinguished traditional craftsmanship back in to the contemporary design process.</p> <p>Materials and fabrication have radically changed in complexity and numbers since the industrial revolution and the environment are on several parameters at a state of collapse, so the situation calls for a new approach to raw materials and manufacturing. This brings us in to a field defined by art, natural science and technology where designers manipulate, grow or develop the material for a product in the same process as designing form and function.

One of the pillars of the evolving body of knowledge that constitutes Transition Design is that of the theories of change, that is, the mental, theoretical and practical frameworks under which change happens and is meant.

These provide a structure for students\u2019 own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times.</p> <p>Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging.</p> <p>The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project.

And the present for 2019 is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate doubts about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres.</p> <p></p> <p>Any cartography we use for understanding the present requires an analysis of the main crises that determine our collective future. Towards the end of the 21st century, these include at least:</p> <p>An ecological crisis that is the background for all other crises, and which determines the action pathways for global societies in a decisive way. A crisis that is not only environmental but also political and economic, being determined by the route of the Paris Agreement, an unprecedented historical project spanning decades. And above all, because it is also a philosophical crisis, that of the project of recomposing our vision of the relationship between culture and nature, a relationship that has changed without the possibility of turning back.</p> <p>A crisis of the economic regime that has articulated the group of developed nations for the last 40 years: neoliberalism, which today is unable to guarantee the welfare of contemporary societies, destabilized by precariousness and inequality. And the emerging stories about a next model, still discontinuous and tentative, that begin to articulate around the notion of postcapitalism.</p> <p>Multiple crises of sovereignty and representation, which have opened a gap between institutional politics and citizenship, creating a space of opportunity for which new political movements with multiple origins struggle: from activism and grassroots social movements, to media populisms or the xenophobic reactionary movements. Together with these, a crisis of the global geopolitical order, which is once again dominated by the tension between poles. And of course, a crisis of the nation-state of the twentieth century, which is fragmented in search of other possible configurations for the 21st century.</p> <p>A crisis of the discourses of the most recent utopia, the digital utopia, and of the visions that found in technological innovation the answer and the cure to all the other crises. The technological regime of the last 15 years has ceased to be perceived as an unequivocal force of progress, and citizens begin to distrust some actors, the giants of Silicon Valley, who have perfected new and disturbing mechanisms of exploitation, eroding the fabric of our societies.</p> <p>A crisis of the productive model and the nature of work in the face of the growing development of automation and robotization and Artificial Intelligence. A crisis that places nation-states in direct conflict with new agents, whose impact and ability to influence rivals that of governments. And in which new imaginaries emerge about what a world would look like after work, and horizons like the myth of the Universal Basic Income</p> <p>A crisis of the cultural and social hegemony of privileged groups that are overrepresented in politics, culture or business. The thrust of alternative stories and the active mobilization of a multiplicity of collectives \u2014from women and migrants to the LGTBQI collective\u2014 calls for a more diverse society, with a more equitable distribution of power.</p> <p>A migratory crisis of those who escape from all other crises, in a world in which economic, political and climatic refugees multiply, and in which protectionist speeches return and barriers are raised again.</p> <p>These vectors, and some others, define the territory in which we build our collective projects and our hopes for collective development. What does it mean to live and coexist in these conditions of departure? How do we design for these times that are necessarily cyborg and for the anthropocene? What narratives, images, symbols and aesthetics help us find and recognize ourselves in this space?</p> <p>From these 9 vectors, this seminar presents stories, narratives, proposals and images that allow the construction of an Atlas of Weak Signs for the design of Futures.</p>"},{"location":"2019-20/t-2/atlas-of-weak-signal/#deliverables","title":"Deliverables","text":"<p>Presentations, one per group in the last 4 classes.</p>"},{"location":"2019-20/t-2/atlas-of-weak-signal/#faculty","title":"Faculty","text":"Jose Luis de Vicente Fabrication Expert <p>Jose Luis de Vicente is a cultural researcher and curator working in the space between the arts, technology, and innovation.

It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges.</p> <p>The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students\u2019 own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times.</p> <p>Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging.</p> <p>The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention\u2019, that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture.</p> <p>Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty.</p> <p>The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015.

It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges.</p> <p>The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students\u2019 own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times.</p> <p>Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging.</p> <p>The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention\u2019, that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture.</p> <p>Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty.</p> <p>The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015.

The local pilots connected to the SISCODE and CENTRINNO EU projects, while differing in specific objectives and goals, have been aligned with the Fab City principles and share a common objective: both expand the purpose of creative spaces and practitioners to transform communities, societies and ecosystems, supporting the development of new approaches to innovation, learning and impact at the local level, while articulating global efforts.</p> <p>Within the context of the above-mentioned projects, during the two sessions, students will practice with methods to support social change whilst focussing down on the purpose of engagement. By learning and understanding the application of tailored tools and their practical uses, students will have access to knowledge and resources to use in their future projects. The pool of tools ranges from enabling actions to map actors and resources, analysing local contexts, identifying potential synergies and opportunities, and amplifying key benefits for local stakeholders.</p> <p>The practical course will be further enriched with thematic topics addressing circular and collaborative manufacturing, co-creation mechanisms, practice-based capacity building and peer-learning. During the two days of activities, students will also have the opportunity to visit and engage with four local community-driven projects in Poblenou.

This is set as a primary goal to foster the students\u2019 capacity to design and conceptualize their projects with the tools and skills they might have available, without limiting the possibilities of what they could achieve. In addition, the challenges align with the MDEF design studio in an effort to connect each challenge topic to the current status of the design interventions of the students.

It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges.</p> <p>The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students' own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times.</p> <p>Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging.</p> <p>The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention', that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture.</p> <p>Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty.</p> <p>The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015. MDEF is dedicated to scaling up the impact of maker practices and reimaging how design can be central to enacting a paradigm shift towards preferred plural futures.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/#tracks","title":"Tracks","text":"<p>The Master is structured around four conceptual dimensions: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application.</p> <p>These four tracks provide designers with the strategic vision and tools to work at multiple scales in the real world. The theoretical and practical content in the program recognises and explores the possibilities of disruptive technologies: digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence and others.</p> Instrumentation <p>Students learn a modular set of maker skills and tools and how these can be used in the design process to translate their ideas into prototypes and prototypes into products. Skills include coding, digital fabrication, hardware design, synthetic biology, and computational thinking.</p> Exploration <p>Students are exposed to a set of technologies and sociocultural phenomena that have the capacity to disrupt our present understanding of society, industry and the economy. Technologies include Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.</p> Reflection <p>Students are supported through individual and group reflection sessions to develop their own identity and skill set, knowledge and attitude as designers. A series of presentations and visits from key professionals helps make students aware about how their thinking, making, interests and values differ from others.</p> Application <p>Students create design responses to explore their curiosities through innovation.

Therefore, the objective is to combine the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the weeks prior to the challenge in order to ideate a small project that is connected to their personal interests and individual or collective interventions. The students have to use the technology and equipment available and focus on the specific skills they have already acquired during the past weeks. This is set as a primary goal to foster the students\u2019 capacity to design and conceptualize their projects with the tools and skills they might have available, without limiting the possibilities of what they could achieve. In addition, the challenges align with the MDEF design studio in an effort to connect each challenge topic to the current status of the design interventions of the students. As mentioned before, the intention is to weave the two courses together in order to enhance both for the benefit of the students\u2019 projects. The design studio provides a critical context in relation to the technologies developed during Fab Academy, and in return the Fab Academy course yields the skills and knowledge to help physicalize these concepts.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t-2/digital-prototyping-for-design/#weekly-classes","title":"Weekly Classes:","text":"<p>This classes are given every two weeks on Wednesday and Thursdays from 10 Am to 14.00 Pm (CET time) for two weeks in a row.

The seminar aims to build a space for honest discussion, questioning, and challenging, in which we aim to incorporate philosophical practice into designing for emergent futures.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t-2/making-sense-and-meaning/#papers-to-read-and-video-to-watch","title":"Papers to read and video to watch","text":"<p>How Humanity Came To Rule The World | Yuval Noah Harari &amp; Neil deGrasse Tyson</p> <p>[Design as participation:]( (https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/design-as-participation/release/1)</p> <p>[A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things:]( (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319143816_A_History_of_the_World_in_Seven_Cheap_Things)</p> <p>[Steps to an Ecology of Mind:]( (https://ejcj.orfaleacenter.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1972.-Gregory-Bateson-Steps-to-an-Ecology-of-Mind.pdf)</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t-2/making-sense-and-meaning/#course-completion-requirements","title":"Course completion requirements","text":""},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t-2/making-sense-and-meaning/#breakdown","title":"Breakdown","text":"<p>Participation: 40% Attendance: 20% Essay: 40%</p> <ul> <li> <p>To read the provided articles and papers</p> </li> <li> <p>To attend at least 80% of the classes</p> </li> <li> <p>To write a blog entry of between 1500-2500 words at the end of the course on your website and design a vignette to illustrate the (some) following questions (feel free to replace them by more meaningful ones to you):</p> <ol> <li> <p>How design can reconfigure systems of extraction?</p> </li> <li> <p>Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools?</p> </li> <li> <p>How can we design the transition towards these worlds?</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>Suggestion: Feel free to use ChatGPT and other AI tools to write and illustrate the class assignment.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-1/t-2/making-sense-and-meaning/#late-assignments","title":"Late Assignments","text":"<p>Late work will be deducted 5% per twenty-four-hour period that elapses after the due date.

They are the drivers of the global economy, centres of creativity, diversity, and  interaction - and they are home to the majority of the global population. Cities cover only 3% of the earth\u2019s surface, yet they consume 75% of global natural resources, making them effective places to address critical environmental and social challenges. A large part of the environmental impact of cities can be attributed to the Built Environment. Roughly 40% of all carbon emissions are related to this part of our economy. 10% can be attributed to embodied carbon, where 30% can be attributed to energy consumption.</p> <p>Growing urban regions and consumption patterns combined with an extractive and wasteful economy create many adverse environmental impacts both inside and outside of our human habitats. Our linear economy is at the root of these challenges: core to this economic model is a fundamental disconnect between how we live our lives and do business, and what this means for the natural ecosystems that allow us to live happy, healthy sustainable lives.</p> <p>In 2004 it was estimated that at the current rate of mining, we are left with 32 years of copper, 23 years of tin, and 21 years of lead (C.O\u2019Donnell, D.Pranger).

It will be used as a holistic framework to assess trade-offs and understand the net positive impact of the design decisions and solutions.</p> <p>Secondly, students will map the materials and their respected embodied carbon coming in and out of a chosen case study. By analysing the process that construction materials go through, from the extraction of the raw materials, transportation, manufacturing, and assembling, to the end of life scenarios, and understanding the potential ways of shifting this linear thinking towards more circular approach, will highlight the global impact of the case studies in relation to the CO2 emissions and the environmental footprint.</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-2/modules/circular-matter/#learning-objectives","title":"Learning Objectives","text":"<p>At course completion the student will:</p> <ul> <li>Be familiar with the principles of systems thinking and impact assessments to identify root causes and leverage points in achieving progress towards a sustainable change;</li> <li>Understand the basics of the circular economy as it relates to the urban context and the built environment, including potential applications and their limitations;</li> <li>Be able to map the material flows and their embodied carbon through the lifecycle;</li> <li>Be familiar of the environmental impact caused by analysed materials and how to design for reducing it;</li> <li>Be able to bring these tools into practice and assess how the individual master thesis project addresses the issues that need to be solved, identify systemic barriers to implementation and propose solutions that can help overcome them.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-2/modules/circular-matter/#grading-method","title":"Grading Method","text":"<p>European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)</p> <p>3 ECTS</p>"},{"location":"2023-24/year-2/modules/circular-matter/#additional-resources","title":"Additional Resources","text":"<ul> <li>McDonough, W. and Braungart, M.

It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges.</p> <p>The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students' own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times.</p> <p>Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging.</p> <p>The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention', that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture.</p> <p>Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty.</p> <p>The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015. MDEF is dedicated to scaling up the impact of maker practices and reimaging how design can be central to enacting a paradigm shift towards preferred plural futures.</p>"},{"location":"2024-25/#tracks","title":"Tracks","text":"<p>The Master is structured around four conceptual dimensions: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application.</p> <p>These four tracks provide designers with the strategic vision and tools to work at multiple scales in the real world.

The space works in a collective self-management way and wants to promote the exchange of knowledge and the creation of new forms to enable other ways of generating music and experimental sound. </p> <p>www.mutanmonkeyinstruments.com/es</p> <p>9:30-11:30</p> <p>Session with Laura Ben\u00edtez - Beyond local territories</p> <p>This session focuses on territoriality and third spaces. The proposal addresses notions of territory and community beyond the simple local-global scale. The generation of communities and collaboration does not occur only in encounters within the same territory. We will explore different notions and projects to help us think about a design with others beyond local territories. </p> <p>11:30-13:30</p> <p>Visit to BeAnotherLab (TBC) </p> <p>We will visit the collective/project Be another lab in the second part of the session. </p> <p>BeAnotherLab works at the intersection of art, science and technology. We question the hierarchies between these different ways of knowing and approach them as complementary, overlapping bodies of knowledge. BeAnotherLab is a not-for-profit cultural association registered in Barcelona. Their innovations are licensed under the Creative Commons Share-Alike License. They are driven by an action-research approach, and the laboratory has developed a range of methodologies for interfacing with differences, always aiming to translate and connect in a context-specific and situated manner.</p> <p>www.beanotherlab.org</p>"},{"location":"2024-25/year-1/t-1/design-with-others/#methodological-strategies","title":"Methodological Strategies","text":"<ul> <li>Lectures</li> <li>Case studies</li> <li> <p>Visits</p> </li> <li> <p>Project-based learning</p> </li> <li>Team-based learning</li> <li>Visual thinking</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2024-25/year-1/t-1/design-with-others/#deliverables","title":"Deliverables","text":"<p>One of the deliverables will consist of designing an intervention with a community/collective, considering the lessons learned in the seminar.

Therefore, the objective is to combine the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the weeks prior to the challenge in order to ideate a small project that is connected to their personal interests and individual or collective interventions. The students have to use the technology and equipment available and focus on the specific skills they have already acquired during the past weeks. This is set as a primary goal to foster the students\u2019 capacity to design and conceptualize their projects with the tools and skills they might have available, without limiting the possibilities of what they could achieve. In addition, the challenges align with the MDEF design studio in an effort to connect each challenge topic to the current status of the design interventions of the students.

Metropolitan areas are therefore key in addressing such issues to maintain the wellbeing of all living things. To this end, concepts like renaturing and rewilding offer an unprecedented challenge for designers: to approach urban landscape under a dynamic, collective, multidisciplinary and multiscalar perspective. These approaches are often developed in order to counteract the impacts of anthropogenic pressures on the ecology, rather than empowering ecology to actively adapt within today\u2019s highly urbanised world, becoming an active partner within the definition of this transition.

It evolves the practice of design beyond objects, aesthetics, form finding and pure speculation through a unique hands-on-learning approach. Our method uses practical design processes to investigate complex systemic problems and proposes city-scale interventions to approach large-scale challenges.</p> <p>The master has four pillars: Exploration, Instrumentation, Reflection and Application. These provide a structure for students' own personal and professional exploration and build the strategic vision and flexible skill set to design in uncertain times.</p> <p>Students develop their technical capabilities through the global Fab Academy program. This program equips students with working knowledge across the multiple disciplines of a Fab Lab from coding to digital fabrication. By the end of the Master students will be competent in a range of maker skills which they can apply to their final projects. At the same time, MDEF asks students to critically engage with the fields of speculation and foresight studies; they assess the role of disruptive technologies such as digital fabrication, blockchain, synthetic biology, Artificial Intelligence in the current transformation of society. Critically analysing our today helps students design for the futures that are emerging.</p> <p>The practical and theoretical aspects of the Master are combined to develop a portfolio of strategies, reflections and prototypes as well as a final project. Investigation is situated in Barcelona city, where students can collaborate with local stakeholders to apply their knowledge to human centered needs. The final project is a \u2018design intervention', that is, a solution or response in the form of a product, platform or deployment. Working on hyperlocal interventions gives students a tangible design output that responds to a trend that is emerging at a global level and the potential impact of technology in business, education, society and culture.</p> <p>Previous graduates of MDEF have proceeded to work in the subjects in which they specialised during the master. Specialist subjects ranged greatly \u2013 from understanding democratic governance and trust; questioning our food systems and how they will look in the future; new material development through synthetic biology; training fungi to consume chemical composites amongst many other varied topics facilitated by the unique environment created by the Master and Faculty.</p> <p>The Master in Design for Emergent Futures approach has been developed out of the Exploring Emergent Futures platform at the Royal College of Art, London, a program developed by James Tooze and Tomas Diez since 2015.

Metropolitan areas are therefore key in addressing such issues to maintain the wellbeing of all living things. To this end, concepts like renaturing and rewilding offer an unprecedented challenge for designers: to approach urban landscape under a dynamic, collective, multidisciplinary and multiscalar perspective. These approaches are often developed in order to counteract the impacts of anthropogenic pressures on the ecology, rather than empowering ecology to actively adapt within today\u2019s highly urbanised world, becoming an active partner within the definition of this transition. This is highlighted by the fact that the great majority of today\u2019s legal systems only protect the rights of humans, often considering nature as one of the resources to be exploited \u201cfor the exclusive benefit of our own species.\u201d (Thackara, 2015). These frameworks have the potential to empower designers to engage with nature as an active partner, questioning the status quo approach to considering and planning nature as a resource \u2013 for humans to exploit.</p> <p>We aim to reconsider the polarisation between environmental forces and anthropocentric ones, providing an opportunity to consciously design for, and within, climate change adaptation, shifting inclusive design from a human-centric vision, to one that is also nature-centric.

When written in the Front Matter, make sure the track names are written correctly and with the first letter capitalized. If this is not done correctly, the corresponding icon will not appear properly in your intro banner and the course will not be included in module lists, like this one.</p> <p>course_type: The course types are less rigid in their formatting than the tracks. They will appear at the top of the banner image next to the track type written just as they are input into this field (respecting capitalization, etc.). The original course types agreed upon are: workshop, seminar, short course, and long course, with only one course type being selected under ideal conditions. These should be written with the first letter capitalized to respect formatting guidelines, but on a technical level not doing so will not produce an error.</p> <p>feature_img: The featured image will appear as the banner image on a module page. The image will automatically be cropped to a 16/9 aspect ratio cropping evenly, thus prioritizing the center of the image and standardizing the sizes of the images without additional work. Likewise, the image has a color overlay for stylistic purposes, this cannot be changed. To define a featured image, you need to define a relative path as described in the image section of this guide.</p> <p>Saving images</p> <p>All images should be saved in the <code>assets</code> folder under <code>images</code> to maintain order. For module courses, these images are saved in the corresponding year, and then term. An example of the location of featured image can be seen below in the example of Front Matter with the content filled out. Image files should be reduced to be less than 1000KB (1MB) to ensure fast loading of the page. The naming convention for these images is the name of the course in lowercase with dashes between words.</p> <p>img_caption: The image caption will be added just as it is written below the module banner image. If this is left blank or simply not included, no caption will appear.</p> <p>faculty: Since there can be multiple faculty on a single module, this <code>key</code> allows for a list of <code>values</code>, so it has a slightly different format. In this case, even if there is a single faculty member to list, a line break is needed, followed by a tab, dash (-), a space, and then the faculty name. The format of the faculty name should be firstname-lastname. (See the example below). Naming conventions correspond to the faculty files, so these should match exactly. This will be covered later in the section on adding a new faculty member.</p> <p>ects: This is the amount of credits that this course is accredited for.</p> <p>Troubleshooting Front Matter on module pages</p> <ol> <li>Front Matter must start and end with three dashes (---) on their own lines.</li> <li>Following each <code>key</code>, there must be a colon (:) followed by a space. If you do not include this space, it will produce an error.</li> <li>Some <code>keys</code> can have multiple <code>values</code>, like in the case of faculty. <code>Keys</code> like this have a slightly different formatting. The <code>values</code> should be written each on a new line, tabbed in once, followed dash (-) and a space then the value as described above.</li> </ol> Example with content:<pre><code>---\ntitle: Extended Intelligences\npage_type: course\ntrack: Exploration\ncourse_type: Course\nfeature_img: /assets/images/2023-24/year-1/t-1/extended-intelligences.jpeg\nimg_caption: Martian Species, Estampa, 2021\nfaculty:\n    - ramon-sanguesa\n    - lucas-pena\n    - pau-artigas\nects: 3\n---\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"contribute/#expected-sections-within-module-pages","title":"Expected sections within module pages","text":"<p><code>{{ insert_banner() }}</code></p> <p>Make sure you include the line <code>{{ insert_banner() }}</code> following the Front Matter or the banner image will not appear even if all the details are correctly filled out.</p> <p><code>## Syllabus</code></p> <p>Includes: Syllabus content and keywords.</p> <p>EXAMPLE:</p> <p>The first term Design Studio aims to create a solid ground for the students to start developing their projects.
